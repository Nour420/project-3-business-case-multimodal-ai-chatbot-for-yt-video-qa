        "transcript": "Few of the monsters that evolution created have been so successful at hurting us as the variola virus responsible for smallpox The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless that it compelled humankind for the first time to act truly globally It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature all made possible by cows Variola is a virus a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself Evidence of it has been found in Egyptian mummies and in writing from India and China as old as 3 000 years 1 300 years ago smallpox killed up to a third of Japan s population By the 1600s it was one of the major causes of death worldwide In late 18th century Europe it killed 400 000 a year Every third person who went blind did so because of this virus Even in the 20th century a hot second ago in history it still killed at least 300 million people Smallpox is an abusive monster that returns over and over and over again killing maiming and disrupting societies How could variola be so incredibly deadly for so long and how could we have forgotten its horror so quickly In 2023 there are only two laboratories left where the living virus is officially stored for research in Kosovo Russia and Atlanta USA Which is certainly a good idea because what could possibly go wrong Let s say that through an unfortunate series of events the virus got out and you got infected What would happen to you How smallpox kills Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride in small droplets you breathe in Immediately it begins to infect the cells that line your throat and starts killing them to cause chaos Why To trick your body into giving it a lift Whenever cells in your body die a violent death your immune cells immediately stream to the site of infection to help out In this case that backfires horribly As immune cells begin cleaning up dead cells eating viruses and killing infected cells Variola infects a crucial cell of your immune system your dendritic cells intelligence cells that gather information and leave the battlefield to get help They enter your lymphatic system a highway network that spans your entire body and connects hundreds of immune bases In these bases your heavy defenses are activated and should be the last place an enemy would want to invade but Variola wants to get here For about 12 days the virus quietly infects civilian and immune cells jumping from cell to cell infecting more and more of them At some point a critical threshold is reached and variola starts its attack for real Millions of viruses use the lymphatic highway to spill into your blood and organs infecting your whole body Suddenly variola is everywhere But despite this global attack your adaptive immune system is struggling to wake up Your immune cells look for and use critical transmitters called interferons to mobilize the body against viruses Interferons as the name suggests interfere significantly slowing down virus infections but also quickly activating millions of antivirus weapons But Variola is able to deactivate interferons which stuns the antivirus side of your defense system Other systems would usually help like the complement system a sort of mobile minefield that can destroy viruses But Variola manages to shut this down too And so with little resistance Variola spreads everywhere and infects billions of your cells all over your body Among the infected are your capillaries the smallest blood vessels in your body which die in great numbers All this death activates an immune cell that you really don t need right now but that s attracted by death the neutrophil Normally an efficient killer of invaders great and small it s not very effective against smallpox And even worse neutrophils fight by vomiting deadly chemicals which kills even more of your cells On top of that they order inflammation fluids streaming from your blood vessels into your tissue All over your body as first millions then billions of your cells die you get a rash that only gets worse and worse Pus and cellular junk fills it up as your body swells up with hundreds of lesions all over your skin and inside even on your organs all filled with billions of variola viruses now the critical phase begins as you fight for survival you burn up in a high fever thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of fluid that streams into your tissue and organs Blood clotting appears all over your body while floods of toxins from dead cells build up and can cause organs to fail Your lungs fill up with fluid making it harder and harder to breathe One of two things happens now Either your immune system wrestles back control heavy weapons have been dispatched killing infected cells cleaning up the thousands of infections one by one killing variola wherever it can be found so you can slowly begin to recover The immune system will forever remember variola making you immune forever Or you die overwhelmed by the infection and your immune system s panicked reaction to the body wide infection About a third of people who can track smallpox don t survive And if you survive you re very likely branded by scars and may even lose your eyesight or hearing For thousands of years this terrible disease ravaged the world leaving death and destruction traumatized and maimed survivors Until one day humanity said enough Why don t we have smallpox anymore Smallpox is one of the worst diseases humanity has ever known A murderous family destroying life ruining monster There was nothing you could do for the infected but people noticed that if you survived you were immune So out of desperation they came up with the dangerous practice of variolation Take scabs from an infected person that had a mild case of smallpox let them dry out and grind them to a fine powder Then blow the powder up the nostril of a patient or scratch their skin with it If things went well they only got a mild version of smallpox and gained immunity against the disease Variolation probably worked because it introduced variola in a part of the body the virus wasn t prepared for disabling most of its nasty tricks And because the inoculation was left to dry out that damaged the virus so it couldn t cause the full disease Unfortunately 2 3 of all patients still died because they got the smallpox or suffered other diseases as a result of treatment Still smallpox was such a horrible and to some degree unavoidable disease that people took the risk for themselves and their children Variolation spread around the globe while variola continued to kill millions A victory over the virus only became a real possibility when scientists realized that it wasn t necessary to variolate with the real smallpox disease but much safer to use material from cowpox a variant that affected surprise cows A truly revolutionary step and only a few years later this led to one of humankind s most outstanding achievements vaccinations The innovation was simple Instead of using the real virus to train the immune system use a related virus cowpox that was only mild but also gave you immunity Still it would take another 200 years countless individuals fighting the monster where they could delivering vaccines to the most remote places on Earth All the while the disease ravaged on killing over 300 million people in the 20th century alone In 1966 the World Health Organization decided that humanity had to come together in a final major effort A global smallpox news network based on residents in hotspots was created tackling local outbreaks of the virus Cases were encircled vaccines given preventing further spread Smallpox only infects humans so if we stopped the human transmission chain we would starve the virus The last naturally occurring infection was in 1977 and in 1980 just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine was used smallpox was declared eradicated Variola the scourge of humanity was dead No more children would be killed by it no more mothers or brothers or uncles or cousins It s hard to convey to people around today what an incredible win this was One of the cruelest most dangerous monsters that has hunted us for literally millennia was slain by us apes with pointy needles Today we live in a time of enlightenment None of us alive today are haunted by the specter of smallpox This light is not natural It was set in the sky by the sheer will of humankind wanting to be safe from the monsters haunting us But because we live without them we forget that they ever existed and that they are real That the diseases might reawaken or new ones might be brewing in jungles wet markets or laboratories ready to strike us once more We forget what an incredible gift vaccines are and how hard we had to battle to get them We are still protected by the light but it s cooling each and every day and we owe it to those who will come after us to make sure it doesn t go out We killed one monster We can do it again This video

        "title": "How The Immune System ACTUALLY Works \u2013 IMMUNE",
        "transcript": "The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know after the human brain And yet most of us never learn how it works or what it is Your immune system consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs It has its own transport network spread throughout your body Every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army with soldiers captains intelligence officers heavy weapons and crazy suicide bombers It s not some sort of abstract entity Your immune system is you Your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer It s so manifold that it s impossible to cover in one video so we ll make a series looking at different aspects of it Today what happens when your body is invaded and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and death It s been a normal day when suddenly the world explodes and an asteroid rips the sky open Countless alien life forms invade ready to destroy cities and infrastructure and eat civilians Or this is what your cells experience You look at your bleeding thumb that you just cut on a dirty twig in the park How annoying But inside the wound a horrible catastrophe has happened There are dead cells and blood and dirt everywhere Even worse countless bacteria invade the warm caverns between your helpless cells to explore their new home steal your resources and poop everywhere Immediately the first stage of your defense kicks in The cells that survived the impact or are hurt or dying scream in panic releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm signals that awaken your immune system The first cells to show up are macrophages If an average cell were the size of a human a macrophage would be the size of a black rhino A stoic cell in principle but you wouldn t want to annoy it Bacteria do annoy them Within seconds the large cells attack and begin killing them without mercy They stretch out parts like the arms of an octopus and grab the bacteria to swallow them whole and digest them alive A macrophage can eat 100 bacteria before it s exhausted But there are too many enemies so the macrophages call for reinforcements In your blood hundreds of thousands of neutrophils pick up their signals and move to the battlefield Neutrophils are intense suicide warriors that only live to kill They re so enthusiastic about killing that they kill themselves a few days after birth so they don t have time to accidentally destroy your body from the inside As soon as neutrophils arrive they begin vomiting deadly chemicals at bacteria or devour them They are so careless in their attacks that they are causing real damage to your own cells but collateral damage is not their concern now Or ever Some neutrophils go so far to push their suicide button and explode casting wide and toxic nets made from their own DNA filled with deadly chemicals that trap and kill bacteria Sometimes they can continue fighting after that even though they re sort of dead already This is how much fun they have killing While the battle rages your blood vessels let fluid stream into the battlefield like a dam opening up towards a valley You notice this as inflammation Your thumb swells up a little and gets red and warm The fluid brings a silent killer into the battle zone millions of complement proteins A sort of automated liquid weapon that stuns and kills bacteria by ripping holes into them We made a whole video explaining them in detail We re reaching a crossroad now If things go well your first line of defense kills the invaders quickly But sometimes the enemies are too strong and would overwhelm your defenses eventually which means certain death for you the human This is the hour of the dendritic cell your immune system s intelligence officer While your soldiers were bashing in heads it was collecting samples by ripping bacteria into tiny parts and covering itself in it Like a soldier decorating itself in the guts of a dead enemy The cell leaves the battlefield and enters the superhighway of your immune system that connects all your tissues with your immune headquarters your lymph nodes The dendritic cell coming from the battlefield is looking for a helper T cell which is a sort of all purpose commander cell within your immune army But not any helper T cell one that happens to have just the right weapon for the bacteria that infected your wound So it goes around and rubs itself still covered in bacteria parts against every helper T cell it meets Most T cells are a bit disgusted and not interested But after a few hours something clicks A helper T cell recognizes the bacteria parts This cell is the weapon that s needed right now The dendritic cell is overjoyed and activates the helper T cell Okay wait How come your immune system has a cell that has a weapon against the specific bacteria that infected you Well your immune system has a perfect weapon against every possible disease in the universe against the Black Death the Coronavirus or an infection that will emerge in 100 years on Mars We ll talk about this a bit more in the next video because it s very complex so for now just know that you have billions of unique helper T cells that each have weapons against every possible enemy After the right T cell is activated your second line of defense awakes and rises like a teenager that needs to get up on a school day Very slowly Your heavy weapons are incredibly effective but they re not fast The activated helper T cell begins to clone itself over and over again One becomes two two become four until there are thousands of them Now they split into two groups The first group quickly moves to help out your soldiers At the battlefield things are getting out of hand A tired macrophage is ready to give up After fighting for days it just wants to go to sleep like many of its buddies have done already But now the helper T cells arrive One of them comes to the tired macrophage and whispers something using special chemical signals In a heartbeat the demoralized soldier feels fresh again But there s something else A hot white anger The macrophage knows what it needs to do Kill Invigorated it throws itself against the enemies once again All over the battlefield this begins to happen Meanwhile the second group of Helper T cells was working on activating another line of defense B cells your antibody factories Antibodies are protein superweapons that look like tiny crabs with two pincers to grab enemies Just like the helper T cells there are B cells in your body that are able to make just the right antibodies for every possible enemy And the helper T cell is looking for exactly these B cells After a day or two the right B cell is found and begins to clone itself As soon as enough clones have been made each B cell begins pumping out up to 2 000 antibodies per second About a week after you injured yourself and bacteria invaded your second line of defense finally arrives in full force The tiny army begins to saturate the battlefield pinching and stunning desperate bacteria The antibodies clump them together and make them unable to move or fight while your soldiers massacre the defenseless victims The tide is turning fast As the last enemies are cleaned up your soldiers realize they are no longer needed and begin to kill themselves to save resources But not all of them A few helper T cells remain and turn into memory cells They will guard the tissue for years making sure the same bacteria will never again gain a foothold here Similarly a few B cells will stay alive and keep producing a low amount of antibodies making you immune against this bacteria maybe for the rest of your life One day you wake up and notice that the wound has grown over and left nothing but a faint red mark You were completely unaware of the drama your cells had to deal with For you the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance while for millions of cells it was a desperate fight for life and death But this is just the beginning of the epic story that unfolds inside you every day and is told in full in Immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by Philip Detmer the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt The book is a beautifully illustrated deep dive into the immune system the most important thing you don t know enough about that will forever change how you think about your body Written to be as simple and fun as possible it s been an ongoing passion project for almost a decade because the immune system is just about the most amazing and fascinating topic there is So go on a journey and get to know your own body from mystery organs murder universities to the largest library in the universe Explore how incredibly vast your immune system is and how it actually works how it fights enemies from cancer to HIV or just the flu Learn how you can boost it and if that s actually a good idea The book will be out in six weeks and it would mean the world to us and Philip if you could pre order it Pre ordering is super important in the world of books and in contrast to games we can guarantee that it s actually finished and there will be no day one patch There s a link in the description This is the end of a decade long personal journey and we d love to

        "title": "The Immune System Explained I \u2013 Bacteria Infection",
        "transcript": "Every second of your life you are under attack Billions of bacteria viruses and fungi are trying to make you their home So our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards soldiers intelligence weapons factories and communicators to protect you from well dying For this video let s assume the immune system has 12 different jobs For example kill enemies communicate etc And it has 21 different cells and two protein forces These cells have up to four different jobs Let s assign them Here are the interactions Now let s make this understandable First of all let s add colors to the jobs Now let s illustrate the cells The central color represents the main job of the cell while the surrounding ones represent secondary duties Now the immune system looks like this Now the interactions Isn t this complexity just awesome For this video we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest So what happens in the case of an infection It s a beautiful day when suddenly a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself The first barrier of the immune system is breached your skin Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound they start using up the body s resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes at first they fly under the radar but when a certain bacteria population is reached they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them the immune system has to stop them as fast as possible first of all all your guard cells known as macrophages intervene They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body Most of the time they alone can suffocate an attack because they can devour up to 100 intruders each They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed On top of that they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield so fighting becomes easier You notice this as a very mild swelling When the macrophages fight for too long they call in heavy backup by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency Neutrophiles leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield The neutrophiles fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process On top of that they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria They are indeed so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days to prevent them from causing too much damage If this is not enough to stop the invasion the brain of the immune system kicks in The dendritic cell gets active It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer Now the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision Should they call for antivirus forces that eradicate infected body cells or an army of bacteria killers In this case antibacterial forces are necessary It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day Here billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated When T cells are born they go through a difficult and complicated training process and only a quarter survives The surviving cells are equipped with a specific setup And the dendritic cell is on its way looking for a helper T cell with a setup that s just right It s looking for a helper T cell that combined to the parts of the intruders which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane When it finally finds one the chain reaction takes place The helper T cell is activated It quickly duplicates thousands of times Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node and will make you practically immune against this enemy Some travel to the field of battle to help out And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node to activate a very powerful weapons factory Like the T cells they re born with a specific setup And when a B cell and a T cell with the same setup meet hell breaks loose The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast Here helper T cells play another important role They stimulate the hard working factories and tell them don t die yet we still need you keep going This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over so the body doesn t waste energy or hurt itself But what is produced by the B cells You ve heard of them of course Antibodies Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body Meanwhile at the site of infection the situation is getting dire The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body Guard and attack cells fight hard but also die in the process Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer But without help they can t overwhelm the bacteria But now the second line of defense arrives Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders rendering them helpless or killing them in the process They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target Their back is built to connect to killer cells so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily Macrophages are especially good at gnoming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to Now the balance shifts In a team effort the infection is wiped out At this point millions of body cells have already died No big deal the losses are quickly replenished Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals they commit suicide so as not to waste any resources But some stay behind The memory cells If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice This was a very very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work Can you imagine how complex this system is Even at this level when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry Life is awfully complicated but if we take the time to understand it we always encounter endless wonders and great beauty"

        "title": "The Deadliest Being on Planet Earth \u2013 The Bacteriophage",
        "transcript": "A war has been raging for billions of years killing trillions every single day while we don t even notice The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet the bacteriophage or phage for short A phage is a virus Not quite alive not quite dead Also they look as if someone made them up Their head is an icosahedron a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg like fibers There are more phages on Earth than every other organism combined including bacteria And they are probably everywhere living things exist Billions are on your hands in your intestines and your eyelids right now Which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on Earth But you re lucky While they do commit genocide for breakfast they only kill bacteria Up to 40 of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day But phages also have major flaws Like any other virus phages need a host to survive and reproduce They re not much more than genetic material in a hull and they specialize Usually a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of its very close relatives These are its prey Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family When a phage finds its victim it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture the surface In a weird motion the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information Within minutes the bacteria is taken over It s now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand new phages In the final step they produce andolysin a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies New phages are released and begin the cycle anew In the last few years bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on Earth humans Recently we ve started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies Because we re sort of getting desperate We screwed up In the past a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you Bacteria were our phages Tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly But then about 100 years ago we found a solution in nature By accident we found fungi that produced a compound that killed bacteria antibiotics Suddenly we had a powerful super weapon Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters Only the old and weakest among us were killed by them We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon But bacteria are living things that evolve and one by one they started to become immune against our weapons This continued until we had created what are called superbugs Bacteria immune to almost everything we have This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak By 2050 superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back In the US alone more than 23 000 people die from resistant bacteria each year But it turns out that phages our tiny killer virus robots could save us We can inject them into our bodies to help cure infections Hold on how can injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea Phages are very very specialized killers of bacteria So specialized in fact that humans are completely immune to them We are too different We encounter billions of phages every day and we just politely ignore each other Antibiotics are like carpet bombing killing everything even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don t want to harm Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they re supposed to Wait a minute if we use phages to kill bacteria won t bacteria develop ways of defending themselves Well it s more complex than that Phages evolve too There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years and so far they re doing great This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage we still might be able to win It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics We might be able to trap them in a Catch 22 This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa one of the most feared bacteria infected the man s chest cavity They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics and can even survive in alcoholic hand gel After years of suffering a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to After a few weeks the infections had completely disappeared Unfortunately this treatment is still experimental and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet But things are finally changing In 2016 the largest phage clinical trial to date began and phages are getting more and more attention And we better get used to it because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close It might be a weird concept but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives This video was made possible by a grant from the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation If you d like to support Kurzgesagt you can do so on patreon com slash kurzgesagt and get fancy things

        "title": "Genetic Engineering and Diseases \u2013 Gene Drive & Malaria",
        "transcript": "What if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity s most dangerous predator The deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions The mighty mosquito Along with other diseases it plays host to malaria one of the cruelest parasites on Earth possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history In 2015 alone hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died A new technology could help us eradicate malaria forever But to do so we need to engineer a whole animal population This is not a hypothetical problem The modified mosquitoes already exist in a lab Should we use the technology And is malaria bad enough to risk it Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms Plasmodia Very weird microorganisms that consist of just a single cell They re parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes Malaria always starts with an insect bite In its salivary glands thousands of sporozoites wait until the insect penetrates your skin Immediately after invading you they head for the liver where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system For up to a month they stay here in stealth mode consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form small drop like merozoites They multiply generating thousands of themselves and then burst out of the cells So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next victims red blood cells To stay unnoticed they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells they killed Imagine that Killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as camouflage Brutal They now violently attack red blood cells multiplying inside them until they burst then finding more red blood cells and this cycle repeats over and over Pieces of dead cells spread lots of toxic waste material which activates a powerful immune response causing flu like symptoms Among the symptoms are high fever sweats and chills convulsions headaches and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea If malaria breaches the blood brain barrier it can cause coma neurological damage or death The parasites are ready for evacuation now When another mosquito bites the infected human they get a ride The cycle can start over In 2015 the Zika virus which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women spread rapidly into new areas around the globe It too is carried by a mosquito The mosquito is the perfect carrier for human diseases They ve been around for at least 200 million years There are trillions of them and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time They are practically impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi But today we have new revolutionary technology that could enable us to finally win the war against them CRISPR For the first time in human history we have the tools to make fast large scale changes to entire species changing their genetic information as we please So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects why not just change the types that transmit diseases Using genetic engineering scientists successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium These mosquitoes will never spread malaria But just changing genetic information is not enough The edits would only be inherited by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a failsafe So after just two generations at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene In a population of billions of mosquitoes they would hardly make a difference A genetic engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem It forces the new gene to become dominant in the following generations overpowering the old gene almost completely Thanks to this twist 99 5 of all the engineered mosquitoes offspring will carry the anti malaria edit If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes the malaria blocking genes would spread extremely quickly As the new gene becomes a permanent feature of the mosquito population Plasmodium would lose its home base Scientists hoped that the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough Malaria could virtually disappear If you take into account that nearly half a million children are killed by it every year about five have died since this video started some scientists argue that we should use the technology sooner rather than later The mosquitoes themselves would probably only profit from this They don t have anything to gain from carrying parasites And this might only be the first step Malaria might just be the beginning Different mosquitoes also carry dengue fever and Zika Ticks transmit Lyme disease Flies transmit sleeping sickness Fleas transmit the plague We could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale So why haven t we done this yet For one CRISPR editing is barely four years old so until very recently we just couldn t do it as fast and easily And there are valid concerns Never before have humans consciously changed the genetic code of a free living organism on this scale Once we do it there is no going back So it has to be done right because there could be unwanted consequences if we set out to edit nature In the specific case of malaria though the risk might be acceptable since the genetic modification doesn t make a big change in the overall genome it only changes a very specific part The worst case scenario here is probably that it might not work or that the parasite adapts in a negative way There is still much debate Technology as powerful as gene drive needs to be handled with a lot of care But at some point we have to ask ourselves is it unethical to not use this technology when every day 1 000 children die Humanity has to decide how to act on this in the next few us make more videos like this and get nice rewards in return you can do so here We really appreciate it If you want to learn more about the topic of genetic engineering we have another video about CRISPR and GMOs And in case that s too much biology for you here s a space playlist"

        "title": "This Disease is Deadlier Than The Plague",
        "transcript": "Hi Steve here Today I m moving over as the voice of Kurzgesagt for something really special Our dearest friend John Green would like to tell you a story that s very close to his heart So let s hear it from him directly Hey John Hey Steve Thanks so much Let s dive right in The White Death has haunted humanity like no other disease following us for thousands maybe millions of years It was there when we tamed fire invented culture and ventured out of Africa to conquer the world In 1815 it caused one in four deaths in Britain In the last 200 years it killed a billion people way more than all wars and natural disasters combined Even today it s the infectious disease with the highest kill count but do you even know what we are talking about We re talking about Mycobacterium tuberculosis which causes tuberculosis or TB our original archenemy Right now one in four humans alive are infected with the bacterium You may be one of them So how is it possible that we never hear about TB Well the white death is the perfect human predator Very infectious but very quiet most of the time Careful not to murder recklessly perfectly adapted to your immune system and just physically incredibly hard to kill What exactly makes it so powerful The perfect human predator Usually the bacterium enters your body through the airways and sets up home in the lungs a giant living cave system defended by billions of macrophages powerful guard cells that hunt and kill intruders The TB bug is quickly attacked and devoured alive Unfortunately this is its plan The white death is the worst kind of parasite an immune system parasite Macrophages grab their victims trap them inside a phagosome and flood it with acid that rips them to pieces But TB evolved a thick waxy coat that makes it completely immune to those acids Worse it captures and modifies the macrophage to be a perfect host Like a tiny vampire the parasite slowly consumes the cell TB then replicates extremely slowly Other microbes that make you sick multiply up to 60 times faster exploding their numbers before the immune system can eradicate them But the white death is so well adapted to you it has already won by being here No need to rush things When its host cell is sucked dry and dies the bacteria infect new macrophages Although these bacteria are stealthy the decaying corpses they leave behind do activate a proper immune response Your body knows something is up and mobilizes its forces But once again this is part of the plan Macrophages and many other immune cells try to kill the bacteria but that thick cell wall makes them a formidable fortress and resistant to many attacks And it infects its attackers in the process So when your cells can t kill them they do the next best thing keep the parasites from escaping A granuloma is formed a sort of white blob In the center is a core of infected and dead macrophages a pleasant home and food for the bacterium Other immune cells surround this sphere of death to contain it creating a safe space where TB can sit for years Worse it is perfectly protected from medication and releases chemicals that make it hard for your heavy immune weapons to be activated This is the stalemate version of tuberculosis The infection is sleeping and the bacteria is doing its thing This is going on right now in up to 2 billion people But in 1 in 10 of them the disease will become active Active tuberculosis is an emergency But again a slow one If your immune system can t contain the infection anymore granulomas burst Suddenly your lungs are filled with macrophage corpses and fresh bacteria Your immune system panics and overreacts Hordes of soldiers leave your blood and rush to the infected areas They order inflammation and fluids flood into your lungs But unfortunately your lungs are not made to be a battlefield In their panic your immune cells don t care They re running around with flamethrowers trying to purge the infection but causing terrible damage As fluids and dead tissue amass it becomes difficult to breathe and you begin coughing hard sometimes even coughing up blood And again this is part of the plan because now you spread millions of bacteria catching rides in tiny droplets You burn a high fever and lose weight as your body is severely stressed You turn into a ghost version of yourself Even if you are treated this phase can last weeks to months and is very serious Insufficiently treated TB will over months years or even decades slowly overtake your body Especially for children or those already weakened this can be too much and the disease wins the war The bacterium spreads to other organs lung function breaks down and the patient dies 1 3 million people died this way in 2023 alone The worst kind of problem Tuberculosis is the worst kind of problem A slow one Instead of killing millions quickly like COVID scaring a panicked humanity into frantic action TB is a smoldering fire killing too slowly for our short attention span The symptoms are often mild for many months so you don t feel in danger Tuberculosis doesn t want to kill you of course It wants to stay alive and spread And to do this it exploits human behavior The people you are most likely to infect are your family and friends coworkers or neighbors the people you spend a lot of time with When COVID brought the world to a halt the average patient infected 2 to 3 people An active TB patient infects 5 to 15 people in a year Most people catch it via breathing tiny droplets from a cough or sneeze This is especially common in crowded poorly ventilated housing or workplaces which is why TB exploded during the Industrial Revolution And indeed wherever we see new unplanned and overcrowded urbanization from Lagos to St Petersburg we tend to see a rise of the White Death alongside it Today most cases of active tuberculosis the version that spreads the disease further can be cured with a four month regimen of four different antibiotics But if that s the case how is this still the deadliest infectious disease on Earth Between 1940 and 1965 humans developed several drugs to fight TB finally making it curable It was a true achievement of human ingenuity but we didn t do a great job of distributing the cure While tuberculosis is almost extinct in much of Europe the U S and the Middle East it is still a very real threat in most of the world TB kills people primarily in Africa South America and Asia In 2022 two thirds of all TB cases were in just six countries India China Indonesia the Philippines Pakistan and Nigeria Almost half of all tuberculosis deaths happened in Southeast Asia But as it is a slow problem like climate change it was ignored instead of fought aggressively which enabled more and more strains of TB to develop antibiotic resistance Which is a problem because we kinda stopped making new drugs In the first 25 years of the antibiotic era we developed eight different classes of drugs to treat TB And then in the 47 years between 1965 and 2012 we developed none Developing new drugs is extremely expensive and there was no concentrated effort to eradicate TB and there simply wasn t enough profit incentive There is a vaccine but it s over 100 years old and not particularly effective But beginning in 2012 we did finally develop two new classes of drugs that treat TB and we may finally be at an inflection point again as better vaccines are on the horizon Companies that made COVID tests also developed a quick test for TB So we now have a real opportunity to push this disease back until it dies forever But only if we get enough people to know about TB like you do now and to care about it A century ago in the United States there were almost as many hospital beds for TB patients as for treating all other illnesses and injuries combined The White Death was a leading cause of death in the U S and then one day it just wasn t anymore And we can do this again 4 000 people died of tuberculosis yesterday And we simply don t have to accept a world where so many of us still die of a disease we know how to cure The check out the organization Partners in Health at pih org slash programs slash tuberculosis We ve put a link in the description for you Also if this wasn t enough TB for you there s a crash Course lecture on the history and presence of tuberculosis We ll

        "transcript": "Hello everybody Today we re doing something different An exclusive preview We ll listen to the introduction and a chapter from the Kurzgesagt book Immune A journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive Written by Kurzgesagt founder and head writer Philipp Deppmer It s about the epic story of the immune system The most important thing you don t know enough about and will forever change how you think about your body Immune will be released on November 2nd and you can pre order it right now Links in the description So now get comfy for a rare audio only experience Introduction Imagine waking up tomorrow feeling a bit under the weather An annoying pain in your throat your nose is runny you cough a bit All in all not bad enough to skip work you think as you step into the shower pretty annoyed about how hard your life is While you are totally not being a whiny little baby your immune system is not complaining It is busy keeping you alive so you can live to whine another day And so while intruders roam your body killing hundreds of thousands of your cells your immune system is organizing complex defenses communicating over vast distances activating intricate defense networks and dishing out a swift death to millions if not billions of enemies all while you are standing in the shower mildly annoyed But this complexity is largely hidden Which is a real shame because there are not many things that have such a crucial impact on the quality of your life as your immune system It is all embracing and all encompassing protecting you from bothersome nuisances like the common cold scratches and cuts to life threatening stuff from cancer and pneumonia to deadly infections like COVID 19 Your immune system is as indispensable as your heart or your lungs And actually it is one of the largest and most widespread organ systems throughout your body although we don t tend to think about it in these terms For most of us the immune system is a vague and cloud like entity that follows strange and untransparent rules and which seems to sometimes work and sometimes not It is a bit like the weather extremely hard to predict and subject to endless speculations and opinions resulting in actions that feel random to us Unfortunately many people speak about the immune system with confidence but without actually understanding it It can be hard to know which information to trust and why But what even is the immune system and how does it actually work Understanding the mechanisms that are keeping you alive as you read this is not just a nice exercise in intellectual curiosity it is desperately needed knowledge If you know how the immune system works you can understand and appreciate vaccines and how they can save your life or the lives of your children and approach disease and sickness with a very different mindset and far less fear You become less susceptible to snake hole salesmen who offer wonder drugs that are entirely devoid of logic You get a better grasp on the kinds of medication that might actually help you when you are sick You get to know what you can do to boost your immune system You can protect your kids from dangerous microbes while also not being too stressed out if they get dirty playing outside And in the very unlikely case of say a global pandemic knowing what a virus does to you and how your body fights it might help you understand what the public health experts say Besides all these practical and useful things the immune system is also simply beautiful a wonder of nature like no other The immune system is not a mere tool to make your cough go away It is inextricably tied into almost all other processes in your body And while it is centrally important to keeping you alive it is likely that it may also be the part of your body that causes your untimely death either by failing or by being too active I have been fascinated and obsessed by the incredible complexity of the human immune system for the better part of a decade now It began in university where I was studying information design and was looking for a semester project and the immune system seemed like a good idea So I got a large pile of books about immunology and began digging in but no matter how much I read things just did not get less complicated The more I learned the more impossible it seemed to simplify the immune system as every layer revealed more mechanisms more exceptions more complexity And so a project that was supposed to last the spring took the summer and then the fall and the winter The interactions of the parts of the immune system were too elegant and the dance they danced was too beautiful to stop learning about them This progress fundamentally changed how I experienced and felt about my body When I got the flu I could no longer just complain but had to look at my body touch my swollen lymph nodes and visualize what my immune cells were doing right then which part of the network was activated and how T cells killed millions of intruders to protect me When I cut myself while being careless in the forest I felt gratitude for my macrophages large immune cells hunting scared bacteria and ripping them into pieces to protect the open wound from infection After taking a bite of the wrong granola bar and suffering an allergic shock while being rushed to the hospital I thought about mast cells and IgE antibodies and how they had almost killed me in a misguided attempt to protect me from scary foodstuffs When I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 32 and had to undergo a couple of operations and then chemotherapy my obsession with immunology became even more intense One of the jobs of my immune system is to kill cancer In this case it had failed But I somehow could not be angry or too upset as I had learned how hard of a job this was for my immune cells and how hard cancer had to work to keep them in check And as the chemo melted the cancer my thoughts again went to my immune cells invading the dying tumours and eating them up one cell after another Disease and sickness are scary and unsettling and I ve had plenty of that in my life But knowing how my cells my immune system this integral and personal part of myself defended the entity that is me how it fought and died and healed and restored this body I inhabit always gave me a lot of comfort Learning about the immune system made my life better and more interesting and it alleviated a lot of the anxiety that comes with being sick Knowing about the immune system always put things in perspective So because of this positive effect and just because of the fun of learning and reading about the immune system it became an ongoing hobby as I eventually became a science communicator and explaining complex things became my purpose in life About eight years ago I started Kurzgesagt in a nutshell a YouTube channel dedicated to making information easy to understand and beautiful while trying to be as true to the science as possible In early 2021 the Kurzgesagt team has grown to over 40 people working on this vision while the channel has attracted over 14 million subscribers and reaches about 30 million viewers each month So if this large platform exists why go through the horrible process of writing this book Well while some of our most successful videos have been about the immune system it has always bugged me that I could not explore this wonderful topic in the depth it deserves A 10 minute video is simply not the right medium for that So this book is a way to turn my decade long love affair with the immune system into something tangible that will hopefully be a helpful and entertaining way to learn about the stunning and beautiful complexity that makes it possible for you to survive each day Unfortunately the immune system is very complicated although that is not strong enough a word The immune system is complicated in the sense that climbing Mount Everest is a nice stroll through nature It is intuitive like reading the Chinese translation of the tax code of Germany is a fun Sunday afternoon The immune system is the most complex biological system known to humanity other than the human brain The bigger the immunology textbook you read the more layers of detail start piling on the more exceptions to rules appear the more intricate the system becomes the more specific it seems to be for every possible eventuality Every single one of its many parts has multiple jobs and functions and areas of expertise that overlap and influence each other Even if you make it past these challenges and still want to understand the immune system you will encounter another problem the humans who described it Scientists have laid the foundation for the amazing modern world we get to enjoy today through hard work and endless curiosity and we owe them a great deal of gratitude Unfortunately though many scientists are really bad at choosing good names and coming up with accessible language for the things they discover The science of immunology is one of the worst culprits of any scientific discipline in this regard An already breathtakingly complex field is spiked with words like major histocompatibility complex class 1 and 2 gamma delta T cells interfer alpha beta gamma and kappa and the complement system with actors named C4B2A3B complex None of this makes it a pleasure to pick up a textbook and learn about the immune system on your own But even without this barrier the complex relationships of the many different actors of the immune system with countless exceptions and unintuitive rules are a challenge all by themselves Immunology is hard even for the people working in public health even for the people studying immunology even for the foremost experts in the field All of this makes the immune system horrible to explain If you venture too far into simplification you deprive the learner of the beauty and wonder that lie in the evolutionary genius of the sheer endless complexity that deals with the most crucial problems of living beings But if you include too much detail it quickly becomes mind numbingly hard to keep up with Listing everything every part of the immune system is just too much It would be like telling someone your whole life story on the first date overwhelming and very likely to make them less interested in dating you So my aim for this book is to try to carefully dance around all these problems It will use human language and use complicated words only when necessary Where appropriate processes and interactions will be simplified while staying as true to the science as possible Complexity between chapters will go up and down so after you are fed a lot of information there will be more chill parts to relax a bit And we will summarize what we learned in regular intervals I want this book to make it possible for everybody to understand their own immune system and have a bit of fun doing so And since this complexity and beauty are deeply connected to your health and survival you might actually learn something useful And of course the next time you are sick or have to deal with disease you hopefully can look at your body from a different perspective Also the obligatory disclaimer I m not an immunologist but a science communicator and immune system enthusiast This book will not make every immunologist happy What became obvious right from the start of the research is that there are a lot of different ideas and concepts about the details of the immune system and there is a lot of disagreement between the scientists holding these ideas which is how science is supposed to work For example some immunologists consider certain cells useless fossils while others think they are crucial for your defenses So as much as possible this book is based on conversations with scientists the current literature that is used to teach immunology and peer reviewed papers Still at some point in the future parts of this book will need an update which is a good thing The science of immunology is a dynamic field where a lot of amazing things are happening and different theories and ideas are in flux with each other The immune system is a living topic where great discoveries are still happening Which is great because it means we are learning more about ourselves and the world we live in Okay before we jump in and explore what your immune system is doing let us define the premise first so we have solid ground to stand on What is the immune system what is the context it works in and what are the tiny parts that do the actual work After we have covered these basics we will explore what happens if you hurt yourself and how your immune system rushes in to defend you Then we ll explore your most vulnerable parts and see how your body scrambles to protect from a serious infection And lastly we ll take a look at different immune disorders like allergies and autoimmune disease and discuss how you can boost your immune system But now let us get to the very beginning of this story Before we can really learn about your intricate defense system we should take a look at what needs to be defended Your body In a sense this seems pretty straightforward It is the entire area under and including your skin Simple enough right But just like looking at a planet in space you will never see anything remotely approaching the full picture from orbit So before we do anything else first we need to go on a journey together into a strange and foreign world stranger than the deep sea or an alien planet A world where no living being therein even knows that it exists where monsters are a daily reality but nobody cares A world billions of years old that exists within yourself within everybody and everything all around us omnipresent but invisible This is the world world of the tiny where the border between dead and alive becomes fuzzy where biochemistry becomes life for reasons we still do not understand let us zoom into you and take a look into your organs through the tissue to our most fundamental building blocks your cells Cells are extremely tiny living things among the smallest units of life on earth For a single cell your body is a planet drifting through a hostile universe To understand the enormous dimensions of your body we need to look at it from a cell s perspective At the scale of a cell your body is an utterly gigantic structure of pipes as wide as mountains filled with oceans of fluids rapid torrents permeating intricate cave systems stretching as far as whole countries With the exception of the crystallized and hard parts of your bones all of the environment all of the world really is to a cell alive A cell can politely ask a wall to let it pass and then squeeze through a tiny gap that closes behind it It can swim through channels and hike up mountains of meat to get anywhere it needs to go If you were the size of one of your cells the body of a human would be in the area of 15 to 20 Mount Everest s stacked on top of each other It would be a mountain of flesh at least 60 miles 100 kilometers tall reaching into space If you are near a window take a second and look into the sky Try to imagine this for a moment A giant so large that passenger planes would crash against its lower legs its head so far above you that you would not be able to see it The cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of that especially the weak points where intruders can enter it which is mostly the borders the outsides of the body When you think about your outsides the first thing that comes to mind is of course your skin The total surface area of your skin is about 2 square yards meters about half the size of a pool table and luckily is not that hard to defend since most of it is made out of a hard and thick barrier covered with its own defense system It feels soft but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact Your real weak points to infections are your mucous membranes the surface that lines your windpipe and lungs eyelids mouth and nose your stomach and intestines your reproductive tracts and bladder It is hard to give their total surface area since numbers vary so much from person to person but on average there are about 200 square yards of mucous membranes in a healthy adult about the same as a tennis court most of them being your lungs and your digestive tract You may mistakenly think of your mucous membranes as your insides but this is not true Your mucous membranes are outsides If we took an honest look at what you are you are in a sense nothing more than a complex tube Granted a tube that can close both ends Also a lot wetter slimier and grosser grosser your reproductive organs nostrils and ears are extra holes entrances to large tunnels and additional cave systems that reach through you all of these places are your direct borders contact points with the outside world your body is just wrapped around them these outsides within your insides represent surfaces where millions of intruders are trying to enter you every day A lot of ground to defend when you are the size of a cell For your cells the surface area of the mucous membranes is as big as Central Europe or the Central United States are to you Building border walls would not do the trick for them since they don t need to defend just the borders but the entire surface It s not like intruders are trying to enter just at the edges They could sort of drop in with parachutes So your cells need to defend the entire continent All of it Still it s much easier to catch an enemy at one of these points than somewhere else For example if we took all the blood vessels and capillaries from your body and laid them out in a straight line they would be a baffling 74 000 miles 120 000 kilometers long three times the circumference of Earth with about 1 400 square yards 1 200 square meters of surface area So better catch enemies at the borders that are significantly smaller and therefore easier to defend But easier does not mean easy Let s do a fun experiment and imagine that we wanted to build a human body to scale but from actual people like you Living breathing humans just to see what sort of crazy dimensions we encounter here So first we need a lot of people for that The average human body is made from around 40 trillion cells Trillion 40 trillion is 4 0 0 0 number If we want your cells to be represented by individual people then we need more than 100 times as many people as have lived in the 250 000 year long history of humanity Let s try to visualize this a bit Right now around 7 8 billion people are alive If we put them shoulder to shoulder they surprisingly would only cover an area of around 700 square miles 1 800 square kilometers which is a little bit more than the surface area of London To get 40 trillion people we need to multiply this by 120 And this is only half of the story because your body hosts bacteria that you need to survive How many One bacterium for each of the 40 trillion cells in your body which happens to be a pretty good ballpark in terms of size If you were the size of an average body cell a bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny Let us imagine them as baby bunnies to make the thought less horrifying Most of these cute bunnies live in your gut In this ginormous cave 36 trillion bunnies live their lives constantly dying and reproducing breaking down chunks of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the people making up the continent to flesh The other 4 trillion bunnies are crawling on your skin are inside your lungs hopping over your teeth and your tongue they swim in the fluid of your eyes crawl in and out of your ears We ll talk more about them later but for now just imagine yourself as being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends and have only your best interests in mind Okay so we now have 40 trillion people standing shoulder to shoulder This ocean of people would cover the whole of the United Kingdom every last corner lake and mountain To make a body to scale made of people representing cells we need to stack them until trillions of people are standing on top of each other holding hands and linking arms forming living structures A giant made out of flesh rises 60 miles 100 kilometers into the sky reaching the edge of space The giant is made up of caverns as wide as small countries bones as dense and wide as mountains filled with intricate caves and tunnels Its arteries are filled with oceans of fluid and people carrying food and oxygen tanks to every last corner If you were a red blood cell or in this case red blood person you would travel the distance from Paris to Rome and back once a minute in a stream pumped by a heart as large as a city Things could be great Everybody would work together to keep the mountain of flesh and in consequence themselves alive But the enormous richness of resources and food and the abundance of moist warm space is just too attractive The giant is not only the size of a continent for its inhabitants but also for unwelcome visitors Literally billions of parasites are trying to get inside the flesh giant Some are as large as elephants or blue whales and they want to lay giant eggs so their young can feast on the poor people that make up the tissues Others are the size of raccoons or rats who want to steal the food and make the giant their permanent home to raise generations of their offspring They may not intend to harm the people making up the body but they will do so by defecating everywhere making life miserable The most disgusting vermin our flesh giant has to deal with daily are billions of spiders who want to enter the cell people s mouths or ears to breed in the stomachs of their victims For a giant made up of trillions of people losing a few here and there is not really dangerous But if the vermin were allowed to procreate freely it could be its end Isn t the idea horrifying This is what your cells deal with every single day and night from your birth until the day you die Staying alive is not a thing you should take for granted But don t let this idea of being attacked distress you too much You are not just a mountain of flesh waiting to be conquered Thankfully you have a great ally in this fight for survival that as we now know we simply don t cherish and celebrate as much as it deserves your immune system It makes you a fortress and even more a fortress filled with billions of the most effective and fierce soldiers in the universe They have countless weapons at their disposal and they use them without mercy Your immune system army has already killed billions of enemies and parasites in your life and it is ready to kill billions or trillions more with 45 illustrations in German and English Thank you for listening"

        "transcript": "You re not a person You re a planet made of roughly 40 trillion cells There is so much of you that if your cells were human sized you d be as big as 20 Mount Everest s For your creepy crawly inhabitants this makes your body an ecosystem rich in resources and warmth and space A perfect place to move into and have a family While some of these guests are welcome most are not Your immune system is the guardian of this planet the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion Unfortunately your enemies in the tiny world have a huge advantage Consider the effort it takes to make a single copy of yourself and your trillions of cells First you need to find someone who thinks you re cute date and be awkward and if things work out in a complicated dance two of your cells merge together Then you need to wait for months while the cell multiplies over and over until it s released into the world as a human being And even then you only have a mini copy that needs years to become remotely useful A bacterium consists of one cell It can make a fully grown copy in about half an hour A virus can turn into hundreds within hours and billions within days Your enemies multiply orders of magnitude faster than you Even worse for a bacterium or virus your body is a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure Because they go through so many generations so quickly eventually by pure chance there will be an individual that mutates and adapts in just the right way to resist your defenses and then multiply quickly again In other words you re facing a sheer endless variety of different enemies and you re too slow to keep up with their evolution This is bad Luckily your immune system is just about the most amazing thing ever The second most complex biological system known to us after the human brain and so sophisticated that we still haven t discovered all its secrets Since it s so complicated we have to simplify and focus on one thing at a time If you want the full story wait for the announcement at the end of the video Okay so why are we not all killed by some new bacteria or virus In a nutshell you actually have two immune systems the innate and the adaptive immune system The innate immune system was ready when you were born It mostly consists of general purpose soldiers We introduced them in the last immune video The adaptive immune system carries two types of cells T cells and B cells that are your superweapons and are incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies These cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy but once they re ready they pack a real punch What makes your adaptive immune system so powerful is that it has the largest library in the universe It has an answer to everything You have at least one of these superweapon cells inside you to fight the Black Death the Coronavirus and the first deadly bacteria that will emerge in a city on Mars in 100 years This makes it possible for you to counter the ability of bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly How is this possible To understand what s going on here we need to take one step back All organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts mostly proteins Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes You can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies Why is this important Because proteins are in a way the language of the microworld Cells don t have eyes or ears so to tell friend from foe they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces When a cell connects together with a protein and recognizes it as enemy it knows that it has to attack Only if your cells can make this distinction between friend or foe is your immune system able to fight an invader But since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces This is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year The influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its hull constantly change a tiny bit The soldiers of your innate immune system have a large number of the puzzle pieces for common bacteria and viruses memorized That s why they are your all purpose weapons But they are ineffective against many billions of mutations and adaptations that your enemies can develop So the reason you are still alive is that your adaptive immune system is able to recognize between 1 billion and 10 billion different enemy protein puzzle pieces which is enough to be prepared for every possible enemy But how is this possible How could your immune system possibly have this much of a variety to be prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece Well the cells of your adaptive immune system found a cheat code mixing and matching their own genetic code to create this stunning variety of receptors The details are way too complicated for this video but in a nutshell your adaptive immune cells have official permission to take a tiny part of their own genetic code and mix it in random ways to create billions of different receptors a good way to explain this is by asking you to imagine an army of cooks with each of them wanting their own special recipe they have 100 different ingredients to choose from each ingredient stands for one tiny piece of genetic code in this metaphor So each cook takes a few random ingredients and randomly mixes them together Maybe tomato chicken rice and half an onion as entree marshmallow pepper strawberries and a quarter banana as a dessert Or cucumber beef potatoes and two carrots and blueberries chocolate and cream with a pinch of cinnamon Even with slight variation and with only 100 ingredients there are billions of possible recipes And likewise with just a small selection of gene fragments your cells create billions of receptors The details of this are so cool that they should get their own video or their own chapter in a book In any case by mixing up gene fragments you get up to 10 billion different combinations So in the end you get billions of immune cells and each of them has one specific and unique receptor the dish from our metaphor that is able to recognize one specific protein puzzle piece In total you end up with at least one cell for every enemy that could possibly exist But here we run into a pretty dangerous problem If your adaptive immune system is making weapons that can attack every possible protein puzzle piece in the universe wouldn t it also make some that can attack your own cells Yes it happens all the time This is so fundamentally dangerous to your survival that you have a whole organ that does nothing but work on preventing this The murder university of your thymus Your thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above your heart and you ve probably never heard of it Interestingly your thymus is one of the reasons why your immune system weakens as you age because it s in a constant state of decline once you reach puberty But what does the thymus do In your murder university your immune system is putting your adaptive immune cells through an intense and deadly curriculum Basically it s showing them all sorts of protein puzzle pieces that are used by your own cells to see how they react When a young cell recognizes a body puzzle piece and wants to attack it the teacher s cells order them to kill themselves and they are eaten up and recycled The immune system is so particular about this process that around 98 of your adaptive immune cells that enter murder university die there 2 graduate and get to do their job of protecting you for real If this process goes wrong and the cells escape that can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces this can lead to autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks your own body from the inside And this again is another story for another time Okay let s summarize Your immune system has two parts one that defends you right after birth and one that carries the largest library of superweapons in the universe but needs to boot up first To create billions of different superweapons your adaptive immune cells recombine a part of their genetic code to create a breathtaking variety of attack weapons Then they enter a murder university that only 2 survive to make sure they don t attack you And then you end up with billions of different cells that in total are able to protect you against every possible enemy in the universe Now wait a second If this is all true why do we get sick at all Why was a new disease like COVID 19 able to kill millions of people Well everything we ve just learned about is a tiny tiny window into the amazing struggle for life and death that plays out every day inside your body and there are so many amazing details and questions here How does your body actually find the right cell and time to protect you How do your enemies fight back and overcome your immune system anyway And what about all the things that didn t fit in this video Well today finally marks the release of Immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by Philip Detmer the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt First we had to push the release back because of cargo trouble and then because so many of you pre ordered that we didn t have enough copies for the original launch day Thank you so so much for that Immune tells the epic story of your immune system and will forever change how you think about your own body how you experience being sick and healthy The book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp as Kurzgesagt videos but is able to dive way deeper into its subject So go on a journey through the hidden microverse within yourself Witness deadly wars between billions of invaders and cells learn how your immune system actually works and protects you from cuts cancer and COVID Never before have we so urgently needed to learn about how immunity works Immune is fun and great to look at and it even smells good Follow the link in the description to order it today This is the end of a decade long personal journey working on this so thank you all so so much for your support And thank you for watching and reading"

for resources and space And then there are the strange horrors that are viruses hunting everyone else Not even alive they are the tiniest most abundant and deadliest beings on Earth killing trillions every day Not interested in resources only in living things to take over Or so we thought Turns out there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death and other viruses hunting them Considerably smaller than your cells or even bacteria viruses are nothing but a hull a tiny bit of genetic material and a few proteins No metabolism no way to propel themselves no will or ambition They float around aimlessly and hope to stumble upon a victim to infect and take over Viruses are so simple that we re not sure if they should count as living things or not Some scientists argue viruses are alive Others think that the cells they infect are the actual living viruses hybrid organisms called virocells and the viral particles are more like seeds or spores And many others think viruses are just dead material The origin of viruses is a mystery because how can something that needs victims to make more of itself emerge in the first place There are many ideas Viruses may have been essential steps in the emergence of life or maybe they started out as escaped DNA from cells that became really good at making copies of themselves Maybe they are the descendants of truly lazy parasites that let others do all the work for them The current thinking is that viruses probably emerged multiple times from different origins but we simply don t know for sure yet Whatever the truth is viruses are the most successful beings on this planet There s an estimated 10 000 billion billion billion viruses on Earth If we put them all next to each other they would stretch for 100 million light years 500 Milky Way galaxies wide Very recently viruses became even weirder when scientists found a completely new type Giant viruses nicknamed Gyrus Not only did it break all sorts of records but questioned many assumptions we had about their nature Gyruses even come with their own parasites virophages Viruses that hunt other viruses which seemingly makes no sense at all And since we identified the first one in 2003 it seems like these giants are everywhere we look In the oceans in water towers in the guts of pigs and the mouths of humans And they re even weirder than we thought Gyruses look funny like hairy geometric forms or mini pickles Much larger than all viruses we knew before which explains how they could hide in plain sight for centuries Scientists saw them under their microscopes and just thought they had to be bacteria It s like suddenly discovering there are elephant sized ducks everywhere Most gyruses we ve found so far hunt amoebae and other single celled beings When they find a victim they connect with it and use its natural processes to enter the cell Like all viruses their goal is to misappropriate the victim s infrastructure and procreate Imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth and using your guts and bones and fat tissue to build a mouse factory The gyrus unloads its attack proteins and genetic material and rearranges the cell from the inside Its structural elements protein production machinery and large amounts of mitochondria for energy are changed to become an actual factory called viroplasm Some gyruses even construct a membrane to shield them from the cell s antiviral defenses Once finished the viroplasm begins to assemble new gyruses using the victim up from the inside until it s filled up Finally the invader usually orders the cell to self destruct and releases new gyruses to look for new prey But what makes gyruses special is not their modus operandi or their size even it s that they are much more complex than thought possible for a virus Your cells have around 20 000 genes A typical bacterium has a few thousand genes The coronavirus has around 15 HIV or the flu around 10 The number of genes alone is certainly not everything The tomato for example has 35 000 genes But generally we think of life as a complex system So below a certain complexity level something may be closer to dead material rather than a living organism But gyruses can have hundreds or even thousands of genes blurring the line between living and dead things And it s not just the numbers that are special but also what these genes do We used to think of viral genes as the simplest of instructions just enough to overcome the defense of their victims and make new viruses But many gyrus genes are completely unique basically mystery genes Even more confusing a huge selection of their genes that are actually hallmarks of living things Genes that regulate nutrient intake energy production light harvesting replication or are just necessary to keep cells alive Some recent studies have even suggested that some gyruses with very complex genomes may be able to maintain a basic level of metabolism on their own which if true will shake up what we thought of viruses even more We still don t know anything for sure but one idea about gyrus genes is that they might fundamentally alter the physiology and evolution of their victims by integrating their own genomes and merging with them into chimeric organisms Or the other way around take some host genes with them and be changed themselves For billions of years gyruses may have been existing alongside and infecting cells exerting an unseen influence on the development of life Not just as a parasite but jerking evolution in different directions by mixing genes around in all directions Which brings us to another unique thing about them virophages the viruses hunting gyruses The concept itself is a bit mind boggling How can a thing that might be dead hunt another thing that might be dead too Let s look at one of them The virophage Sputnik is hunting a gyrus called Mammavirus that itself is hunting amoebae Sputnik is a tiny minimalistic virus that doesn t even have the genes and tools to replicate itself What it does have is the ability to hijack the viroplasm factories of mammaviruses So virophages need their victim the gyrus to infect their victim an amoeba first and then they can parasitize it A mammavirus viroplasm infected by Sputnik can only produce very few new gyruses and among these many are deformed and broken unable to infect further cells Instead it makes loads of new Sputnik virophages Other virophages are even more subtle When they infect a viroplasm they just integrate their genetic code into the newly produced gyruses like sleeper agents The next time one of these infiltrated gyruses successfully infects a cell it produces mostly virophages instead of gyruses Gyruses are not completely defenseless though A few years ago the world was in awe when scientists discovered CRISPR a bacteria defense system against viruses It turns out some gyruses have a system that might be similar a sort of gyrus immune system against virophages In turn virophages can also be used as an anti gyrus defense mechanism by living cells Some protists have been found that integrated the genetic code of virophages into their genome and kept it When the protists were infected by gyruses they used the code to create virophages themselves to take over the gyrus factories In the end the protist would still be killed by the gyrus infection but instead of releasing gyruses to kill its buddies it released virophages to hunt them The amazing thing about everything we ve told you in this video is that we re still very much at the beginning It s not even been 20 years since the discovery of gyruses and virophages There is so much going on in the microverse Life is not an isolated event but a ping pong game of trillions of organisms and viruses So when you feel down and like there s not that much new to discover think of gyruses and all the other elephant sized ducks all around us Invisible until we look more closely"

        "title": "The Deadliest Virus on Earth",
        "transcript": "In the 1970s thousands of chicken heads rained from the sky in Europe making foxes and other wildlife confused and very happy Why They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity Since the 1930s a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all Rabies is named after Lyssa the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage and has been haunting us for at least 4 000 years It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses Viruses exist on the edge between life and death hardly more than a few genetic instructions that need living cells to multiply The Lysa virus is simple even for a virus It has only five genes that is the instructions for five proteins that let it solve complex problems infect a mammal avoid its immune system travel to its brain make more of itself and infect new hosts Let s see what happens if you get infected It all starts with a bite most likely by a dog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva pushing them deep into the tissue The goal is your nerve cells your neurons They are living electrochemical wires transferring signals throughout your body and can stretch for up to one and a half meters with their cellular machinery on one end and a terminal on the other The terminal is where cells talk to each other by passing chemicals that convey information Lyssa probably binds to the receptors that are crucial for this process and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells Inside the virus has to solve a big problem It needs to get to the cellular machinery to take over the cell and make more viruses and because neurons are pretty long this can be far away There is a solution at hand though Cells have microtubules spanning their insides that give them structural integrity But they also provide a track system for a specialized delivery system Dynion motors are actual motors that use energy and deliver packages They re made from 50 different proteins 10 times more than the virus and look like a little pair of shoes Lissa uses one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing system and order it to head for the nucleus What s the immune system doing to prevent all of that Well unfortunately not much Usually when a virus attacks your civilian cells are crucial in activating your immune response They notice that they ve been infected and release hundreds of thousands of a special family of proteins The interferons that well interfere with viruses We ll have to simplify a lot but in a nutshell interferons alert your immune system to make antivirus weapons But they do much more They tell civilian cells to turn down their protein factories for a while which means that viruses can t replicate efficiently anymore And interferons tell your cells to become super transparent which is important because how can your immune cells notice that your civilian cells are infected when viruses hide inside them Your body solves this by creating display windows into their insides called MHC class 1 molecules Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive and to showcase to your immune cells what s going on inside them they take random samples of their products and put them into these tiny display windows to give a peek inside Interferons tell your cells to make way more display windows and become super transparent If a cell is infected and forced to make virus parts your immune cells will see these parts in a window and order the infected cell to kill itself and all the viruses trapped within This is one of the most powerful methods of wiping out a viral infection Unfortunately Mlyssa blocks your neurons from making interferons and stays basically invisible to your immune system In contrast to many other viruses when it replicates it doesn t kill its host which would also trigger alarm systems Instead it stealthily jumps from neuron to neuron very slowly making its way to your brain This phase can take weeks to months and very rarely even years and depends on a bunch of things like if the bite was in your face or foot or how many viruses got into your muscles Lissa is a patient monster until it reaches its goal your brainstem Finally the immune system catches on that something isn t right and reacts It dispatches some of your most powerful antivirus cells killer T cells to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the enemy In other viral infections this would be a turning point but in rabies the T cells are rushing towards their doom Simple Lysa with its five proteins plays a you know reverse card using the immune system s ingenuity against itself Your central nervous system is a very fragile part of your body and so the immune system has to be very careful A few haywire immune cells in your brain is a quick way to die So they aren t free to enter your nervous system They have to be invited in and can be kicked out To protect themselves your nerve cells can order T cells to self destruct if they think they re overreacting And Lissa figured out a way to make infected neurons express this order So as your powerful defense cells arrive they are ordered to commit suicide Now the virus infiltrates the brain stem Once this stage is reached you are going to die One of the most irritating things about the Lysa virus is that we still don t know exactly how and why an infected person dies Our usual idea of viruses causing damage is by multiplying rapidly killing their host cells once they ve made enough copies triggering a massive immune reaction that also does a lot of damage But this doesn t seem to be what happens here Brain tissue of rabies patients shows minimal sometimes non existent damage Instead of murdering everything in sight it s currently thought that Lyssa wreaks havoc by messing up the neuron communication inside your brain so much so that it can t function anymore This leads to symptoms like confusion aggression and paralysis Now the virus begins to leave Still traveling through neurons it migrates away from the brain and heads for the salivary glands This is remarkable because after traveling in one direction the virus reverses its course After decades of study we don t know how this works Lyssa ends up saturating your saliva ready for the irate mammal to bite another and repeat the cycle While this seems like the beginning of a zombie outbreak luckily there are no known cases of a human biting another and spreading rabies this way Now the end is near You are rapidly developing encephalitis a swelling of the brain with many unpleasant neurological symptoms from lethargy to paralysis Slowly at first and then suddenly organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma There is no known effective therapy Barely anyone has ever survived Lissa once symptoms begin to show It is by far the deadliest virus we know Except there is actually something that could save you A vaccine Rabies was one of the first diseases humans developed a vaccine for As vaccines do it prepares your immune system for a future attack so it has the right weapons ready in high numbers The horrific tricks of simple Lyssa don t work once you are vaccinated And the vaccine is special for another reason Because Lyssa is so slow in the first few weeks it can be given to you after you ve been exposed So you can still be vaccinated after you ve been bitten by an animal Which is super important if you ve had contact with a sick wild animal say a bat because you often don t even notice a bite from tiny teeth Rabies is a monster One that has followed our species around for thousands of years that our ancestors were terrified of and rightly so It still kills around 60 000 people each year almost half of them children We are far from eradicating this monster It lurks in the shadows in forests and animals of all kinds ready to return in greater numbers if we ever forget how to keep it at bay or if we continue the trend of being suspicious of vaccines Let s hope that one day humanity slays this monster so it can become like most monsters part of our imagination"

        "title": "Your Body Killed Cancer 5 Minutes Ago",
        "transcript": "Somewhere in your body your immune system just quietly killed one of your own cells stopping it from becoming cancer and saving your life It does that all the time The vast majority of cancer cells you develop will be killed without you ever noticing which is an incredibly hard job because of what cancer cells are Parts of yourself that start to behave as individuals even if it hurts you What is cancer and how does your body kill it all the time Cancer is when corrupted cells multiply uncontrollably It can emerge from basically every type of cell in your body so there s not just a single type of cancer but hundreds Some grow slowly others are aggressive some can be treated effectively others are deadly In a sense a cell that becomes cancer turns into something ancient and something new Over billions of years evolution has molded cells to survive and thrive in a hostile environment fighting for space and resources Until a new and exciting way of life emerged cooperation a division of labor that allowed cells to specialize and become more successful together But cooperation requires sacrifices For a multicellular being to stay healthy the well being of the collective has to matter more than the survival of the individual cell Cancer cells stop being part of the collective and become individuals again Your body can handle a few rogue cells but some cancer cells divide again and again becoming a sort of new organism within you taking resources you need to survive competing for the space you inhabit destroying the organs they were part of in the process Despite the harm they cause cancer cells are not evil They don t want to hurt you they don t want anything Cells are protein robots that just follow their programming which unfortunately has been corrupted The soul of the cell In a nutshell your cells have a nucleus filled with DNA It consists of genes instructions for how to build proteins and when to make each one These building instructions are copied and transferred to ribosomes where they re used to make proteins What kind of proteins your cells make determine what they can do The important thing here is that a corrupt gene means you get a corrupt protein which will get important later Your DNA gets a tiny bit corrupted It mutates tens of thousands of times each day Most of the time without any special cause just by being alive Almost all of these mutations are fixed very quickly or are not problematic Still over time as your cells make copies of themselves damage is accumulating Imagine having to make copies from copies from copies for decades Maybe one day a hair got on the scanner or a corner got frayed Each new mistake becomes part of the new copies and all the copies that follow You can increase DNA damage by doing things like smoking drinking alcohol by being obese breathing in asbestos by not using sunscreen or contracting a virus like HPV But the simplest way to damage DNA and get cancer is to be alive long enough For many cancer cases there is no cause other than bad luck The damage that leads to cancer We are simplifying but roughly there are three categories of genes that need to be corrupted so cancer can arise The first key mutation is in the appropriately named tumor suppressor genes or TSGs These genes are a bunch of things For one they produce control mechanisms that continuously scan your DNA for mistakes and copying errors and fix them right away And then they keep normal cells from multiplying recklessly If TSGs become damaged your cells basically forget how to repair themselves and can reproduce unchecked The second crucial mutation can happen in your oncogenes When oncogenes are turned on the cell is told to multiply rapidly They were super active when you were inside your mother s womb To turn a single original cell into trillions in months it needs to divide and grow rapidly These rapid growth genes are turned off when there s enough of you When your oncogenes get corrupted they basically turn on again The third crucial mutation is in your cell s suicide switch Most cells are constantly recycled and refreshed When cells amass too much damage they usually notice and special genes trigger a controlled suicide called apoptosis If the genes that control this process get damaged cells are free to live on despite being dangerously corrupted So if a cell becomes unable to fix the mistakes in its genetic code loses the ability to destroy itself when it notices the damage and begins to grow rapidly without restraint it turns into a young cancer cell These cells have to be killed as quickly as possible While they are bad at this stage they are still pretty weak and easy to kill But if they continue to mutate and increase in number they can learn to avoid your defenses and become a real threat At any moment of your life your immune system is hunting these cells But how do you identify and kill corrupted cells that seem indistinguishable from healthy ones How to find cancer Well here we come back to the proteins your cells produce and the story they tell So if for example your oncogenes switch back on they make oncogene proteins Your immune system knows that they should not be present if you re an adult So to know which cells are corrupt and which are healthy your immune system needs to know what proteins they re making inside To solve this evolution came up with MHC class 1 molecules a sort of display window that makes cells transparent Cells constantly take little samples of the proteins they make and put them into thousands of these MHC molecules to showcase what they re doing The selection is constantly refreshed always giving an up to date picture There s a whole library of proteins that are highly dangerous and should not be made by healthy cells and your immune system has them all on file It has billions of specialized cells called T cells made to recognize specific proteins If a T cell sees a forbidden protein in an MHC display window it knows that the cell is corrupted and kills it immediately But there s a flaw in this system What if a cancer cell mutates and finds a way to circumvent this process All it needs to do is to stop making MHC class 1 molecules and boom it s invisible Without display windows the immune system is blind and can t identify cancer anymore Fortunately evolution found an ingenious solution The natural killer cell A judge jury and executioner The killer At this very second hundreds of millions of natural killer cells are patrolling your body looking for cells that have already turned into cancer or are corrupted by a virus Natural killer cells go from cell to cell to check for one thing Does a cell have MHC class 1 molecules Does it have a display window and is it doing its duty of showing off what s going on inside itself This is so amazing because it covers all of your bases While T cells look for the presence of the unexpected something that should not be here natural killer cells look for the absence of the expected the absence of something that should be here The logic is if a cell does not have display windows it wants to hide something And a cell that hides something must be killed What makes the natural killer cell even more metal is that it s always in murder mode It patrols your body checking cell after cell with the intention of killing it Your healthy cells have to convince it that they should not die today And a way to do that is to have MHC class 1 molecules So in summary almost all young cancer cells you will ever develop in your life will be killed by your immune system Okay but if your body is this prepared why do we still get cancer Well sometimes cancer cells mutate more and get much better at fighting back Cancer is a story of an arms race An arms race that we will win eventually maybe with the help of natural killer cells Right now a number of therapies are beginning to show amazing promise from cancer fighting vaccines to engineered T cells and even natural killer cells We ll look at these therapies in future videos So the war is not won yet but we are on to cancer and eventually it will be eliminated once and for all Maybe sooner than we think This video was made possible in part by direct viewer support and in part through a grant by Gates Ventures Thanks a

        "title": "What Actually Happens When You Are Sick\uff1f",
        "transcript": "There s this idea floating around that what doesn t kill you makes you stronger That surviving a disease leaves you better off And it seems to make sense because we ve all experienced this When you go through hardship often you come out more resilient more ready to face a difficult situation in the future But it turns out that sometimes what doesn t kill you makes you weaker So what happens when you get sick The machinery of war Think of yourself as a large country with a sizable army to defend it You re surrounded by enemies that want to take your land your energy your resources This is a matter of life and death so your body evolved to be sensitive to damage and to the presence of enemies Because this means that an invasion might happen at any moment and that it has to act fast Let s start an invasion and see what happens The moment your cells notice that something is off they release an onslaught of signal proteins called cytokines They re like air raid sirens that activate all sorts of immune cells that then themselves release many more cytokines amplifying the alarm Soon you re flooded with signals that trigger precautions and countermeasures Mobilization is underway Your brain activates sickness behavior and reorganizes your body s priorities to defense The first thing you notice is that your energy level drops and you get sleepy You feel apathetic often anxious or down and you lose your appetite Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and you seek out rest All of this serves to save your energy and reroute it into your immune response You become a country under attack switching into a war economy because properly activating your immune system is intensely disruptive and draining Just like war is expensive for a country as industry switches to building tanks your immune system demands huge amounts of energy amino acids and microelements to build its weapons Take fever It speeds up your metabolism and makes your cells work harder and faster while creating heat that s pretty stressful for many invaders but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain Then your immune system begins to clone millions of specialized immune cells to respond specifically to the enemy infecting you B cells produce millions of antibodies every second each requiring hundreds of amino acids to construct Billions or even trillions of proteins need to be made to refresh the complement system a minefield inside your blood Cytokines the mobilization and information signals also need constant refreshing Usually you acquire your resources by eating But when you re sick your body slows down your digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can t spare So it reaches for the easiest source of amino acids and starts breaking down your muscles All that muscle that you worked so hard for is sacrificed to keep you alive If you re young and healthy and fit you ll make up for that quickly once you re better But if you re old or very young weak or suffer from chronic illness this may be way too draining Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going If your whole system is already strained when you get sick just keeping your immune responses going can overwhelm your capacities Your immune system is a jerk Our enemies too Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies There s a very fragile balance between the damage caused by an infection and the collateral damage caused by immune cells One of your first responders are neutrophils Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns If a neutrophil encounters enemies it showers them with chemicals that cut them open but can also damage civilian cells especially if the patient is already compromised for example by smoking On top of that the microorganisms that invade you often release chemicals and toxins that can cause significant damage and cell death So a serious infection often causes many tiny wounds literally holes in your organs As you can imagine it s not great to have holes and wounds in your organs and your body rushes to close them Your neutrophils and macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells But others are filled with collagen a sort of fixal organic cement that gives your gooey tissue structural integrity You ve seen the result on your skin as scars A scar is different from the original tissue It has no functioning cells in it It s like a sloppily applied cement patch It can t do what the original tissue was doing A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny bit weaker A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter And so as you go through life and survive serious disease after serious disease the functionality of your organs may decrease The damage is usually small enough not to affect your quality of life but can be permanent Okay this sounds depressing but there is actually something you can do to avoid a lot of this damage and train your immune system The best way to train your immune system Your immune system is unique Everyone has a slightly different immune system that s stronger against some enemies and weaker against others which makes evolutionary sense as this protects our species from being wiped out by a single infection Collectively the immune system of the human species is a spectrum Most people respond well enough to an infection a few are super responders and a few don t respond well and die Some people survive the Black Death are more resistant to HIV or coronavirus or even resistant against Ebola Others are killed easily by the flu or are highly vulnerable to certain bacterial infections Where you are on this spectrum is impossible to predict and you also respond differently to every possible infection This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from COVID while for some elderly people it was more like a mild flu The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold is wrong You never know what your immune system is good at until it s tested Getting sick is a gamble in life s casino with your health on the line Always But there is something you can do Hacking one of the best features of your immune system When you survive a disease usually you have better defenses against it afterwards You gain memory cells that are very good at killing the specific enemy you fought that day So you either don t get the disease again or the next infection is much milder And you can use an incredible achievement of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism to prevent damage from disease and train your immune system Vaccines Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease and train your defenses to be ready if it ever shows up for real The goal is to create the same memory cells that you would get after surviving an infection But if you can feel some side effects why should you still do it Nature versus Vaccine Dojo You have two options to train your immune system Vaccine Dojo and Nature Dojo In Vaccine Dojo you train with paper weapons and learn to defend yourself Sure you might get a black eye or a bruise Sometimes after a vaccine you get sick for a few days but that s generally it No scars no permanent damage We discussed vaccine side effects in detail in another video if you want to learn more On the other hand getting a disease to become immune means going to a nature dojo In nature dojo you train with real weapons sharp knives and swords Things might still work out but with way more cuts and wounds But from time to time someone will die be it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza Nature Dojo is just way more risky On top of that the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural resistance because they re engineered to engage your immune system in a more productive way Of course vaccines are not magic and sometimes they don t protect us as well as we d like them to Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly like the Omicron coronavirus or because your specific immune system does not respond well to the vaccine and builds less of a defense Still being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses In the end if we look at the stunning progress humanity has made in the last century eventually we may overcome disease for good But until then we can do our best to take care of ourselves and others Your body and your older self will be grateful to you Diseases are not the only problem humanity can address if we work together We believe the same is true for climate change one of the main challenges of our generation We re very passionate about this topic and we ve covered it extensively in previous videos

        "title": "The Side Effects of Vaccines - How High is the Risk\uff1f",
        "transcript": "Vaccines are celebrated for their part in fighting disease But a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger our health instead of protecting it The internet is full of stories about allergic reactions the onset of disabilities and even death following vaccination appointments And it s true vaccines can have side effects Let s look at how they work and how dangerous they really are Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells soldiers intelligence cells and weapons factories Every day you re attacked countless times but your immune soldiers alone usually deal with that so you don t even notice If an infection becomes serious though our intelligence cells gather intel about the attackers and activate our weapons factories You know the weapon antibodies They re like targeted missiles produced specifically to combat the invader Unfortunately this process takes several days to complete That gives intruders a lot of time to do damage Contrary to popular wisdom what doesn t kill you doesn t make you stronger Our bodies really don t want to fight serious wars over and over so our immune system came up with an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger over time If we fight an enemy that is dangerous enough to trigger our heavy weapons our immune system automatically creates memory cells Memory cells remain in our body for years in a deep sleep They do nothing but remember When an enemy attacks for a second time the slumbering memory cells awaken and order coordinated attacks and the production of antibodies This is so fast and effective that many infections you beat once will never make you sick again You might even be immune against them forever Which is also why little kids are constantly ill They don t have enough memory cells yet And this beautiful natural mechanism is what we build on when we use vaccines How vaccines work As great as memory cells are obtaining them through an infection is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous Vaccines are a way of tricking our bodies into making memory cells and becoming immune to a disease They pretend to be a dangerous infection One way of doing this is to inject invaders that can t do harm For example by killing them or by ripping them into pieces Our immune systems deal with these kinds of vaccines pretty easily Sometimes it s necessary to make our immune system work harder though to produce even more memory cells Live vaccines are the real deal An enemy that can punch back is a bigger challenge than a dead one But this also sounds like a sort of horrible idea What if the germs win To avoid that we breed a sort of weak cousin of the real germ in the lab Just powerful enough to annoy the immune system and create enough memory cells Okay so these are the basic principles of vaccine use They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune against very dangerous diseases Some like the flu virus mutate so often that we need a new vaccine every year but most vaccines protect us for years or even a lifetime But there s a catch Like everything in life vaccines have another side Side effects What are they And what happens if your child develops one The risks of vaccines It s complicated to directly compare the side effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases For example hundreds of millions of people are vaccinated against measles in the West but there were only 83 000 cases in Europe in 2018 So with numbers that different even mild side effects can seem scary compared to the bad effects of a disease that we don t see as much anymore Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963 virtually every single child on Earth contracted measles at some point An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s Every single year But are measles really that dangerous in the year 2019 with our advanced healthcare and new technologies Are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects Let s do a thought experiment based on real numbers Imagine a developed country in a parallel world It has good healthcare but people stop vaccinating In this scenario let s say 10 million children caught measles What happens 9 800 000 or 98 will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash Up to 800 000 of them or 8 will suffer from dangerous diarrhea 700 000 or 7 will suffer from an ear infection which can lead to permanent hearing loss 600 000 kids or 6 will suffer from pneumonia the most dangerous effect of measles It alone will kill 12 000 children Up to 10 000 children or 0 1 will get encephalitis 2 500 kids or 0 025 will contract SSPE a disease where the measles virus lingers in their brain and kills them a few years later Taken together around 2 5 million children will suffer from somewhat serious effects from measles And about 20 000 children will be killed by measles It doesn t stop here though The kids who beat measles are left with a severely damaged immune system that needs a lot of time to regenerate Time for other diseases to do further damage Aside from that what s almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really bad time for about two weeks Okay but what about vaccines It s only fair to look at these risks too So let s repeat our thought experiment but this time we vaccinate 10 million children with MMR What would theoretically happen here After being vaccinated of our 10 million kids around 10 get a fever 500 000 or 5 will get a mild rash Up to 100 or 0 001 might have a serious allergic reaction and will have to be treated Up to 10 boys or 0 0001 might get inflammation of the genitalia And up to 10 kids in total or 0 0001 might get the most serious side effect encephalitis So we vaccinated 10 million kids In total around 120 had side effects that were somewhat serious Thanks to good medical treatment in developed regions almost all of them will be fine What about autism The connection of autism and vaccines stems from one source that has been disproven countless times We ll link to further reading and videos in the description But in 2019 it s fair to say that vaccines do not cause autism Alright but what about deaths It s really hard to say if even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated kids would die We really did look hard and talked to a lot of different experts If we ignore self reporting we could only come up with a tiny handful of documented cases for all the hundreds of millions of children who received the MMR vaccine since 1971 Measles are many many thousands of times more dangerous for your child than even the absolute worst case of vaccine side effects You have to search for lethal vaccine side effects with a huge magnifying glass and even then it s very hard to find confirmed cases while deaths from measles are real and easy to find In 2017 alone 110 000 people died from measles worldwide Statistically today 300 children will die of measles One since this video started You can compare vaccines to seatbelts Are there weird freak accidents where someone gets killed by their seatbelt Well yes But do you personally think it s safer to not put a seatbelt on your kid Wait a second What if your kid is actually allergic What if none of the things we ve said applies to your specific situation In this case you need to become the greatest vaccination promoter of all Because if your children can t be vaccinated only the collective can protect them This is called herd immunity and it s the only thing that can protect your unvaccinated child Herd immunity means that enough people are immune to a disease that it can t spread and dies before it reaches its victims But to accomplish this for measles alone 95 of the people around you need to be vaccinated Conclusion The problem with the debate about vaccines is that it s not fought on a level playing field While the pro vaccine side argues with studies and statistics the arguments against them are usually a wild mixture of gut feeling anecdotes and misinformation And feelings are often immune to facts We ll not convince anybody by screaming at them but we can t hide from the reality of what anti vaccine conspiracies do They kill babies too young to be vaccinated They kill healthy children that are just unlucky They bring serious diseases back from the verge of extinction And the biggest side effect of vaccines is fewer dead children Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have to eradicate the monsters that most of us have already forgotten Let s not bring the beasts back you"

        "title": "The Most Dangerous Weapon Is Not Nuclear",
        "transcript": "A breathtaking scientific revolution is taking place Biotechnology has been progressing at stunning speed giving us the tools to eventually gain control over biology On the one hand solving the deadliest diseases while also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs able to devastate humanity What s going on Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere The cotton in your clothes the vegetables you eat your dog Humans manipulate living things We use bacteria to produce insulin connect prosthetics directly with our brains and make industrial enzymes to produce paper Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable diseases while we re working on food crops resistant to climate change Our mastery over biology has been speeding up so much that within weeks of the first COVID 19 case the unknown coronavirus was broken down in laboratories and analyzed Scientists generated a copy of its genetic material to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began Something unthinkable a decade ago Where is all this sudden progress coming from Well it s complicated But in a nutshell really expensive things got cheap and knowledge of how to do impressive things spread freely The Human Genome Project starting in 1990 was the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety 13 years and 3 billion dollars later it was complete By then the cost of decoding a human genome had fallen to about 100 million dollars Today it s 100 000 times costing only about a thousand dollars How is that possible Converting DNA into computer data and then studying it used to be a super tedious process taking expert humans around three years of manual work Today it takes about two weeks and is almost completely automated Biotechnology has gone from something restricted to the best and well funded laboratories staffed by the world s top experts to something affordable enough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on What s sped up the process even more is that information in the field is shared widely and freely Cutting edge discoveries now take just about a year to be copied in laboratories around the world a few years for anyone with a biology background to work out and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with them in schools Imagine that your local computer repair shop could build a pristine iPhone 11 with just the parts lying around and that teenagers are asked to build a new iPhone 5 for homework Not a crappy homemade version the real thing This is what s going on right now in biotechnology A true revolution We are adding knowledge at unprecedented rates while things get ever faster and cheaper to do This speed means we can expect even more wonderful things for humanity Life saving treatments miracle crops and solutions to problems we can t even imagine right now But unfortunately progress cuts both ways What can be used for good can also be used for bad by accident or on purpose What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard For all the good biotech will do for us in the near future it also could easily kill many millions of people in the worst case hundreds of millions Worse than any nuclear bomb The world just witnessed how fast the novel coronavirus spread We still don t know for sure if it came from nature or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with coronaviruses that s still subject to scientific debate In the end at least 7 million people died And this was still a relatively mild virus that didn t cause serious disease in most of those infected But that might change in the future Wherever the last pandemic came from the next one might very well be our own fault In a sense many things going on in biotechnology could lead to this Most of all how easy it is to work with dangerous viruses Thousands of scientists can simply order the genetic data of infectious virus samples online to experiment with them Assembling these into an artificial virus in 2023 costs about as much as a new car including all the lab equipment At the same time other scientists are trying to find viruses that hide in nature like in wild bats or monkeys There are probably plenty of potentially deadly pandemics out there Virus hunters take samples back to the lab to learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans and catalogue the danger When a biologist discovers a new virus they usually publish its genetic data to the public Journals are eager to share descriptions of potentially dangerous viruses Other labs go further and make viruses more dangerous They combine and mutate different viruses to understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans or make them deadlier than their original forms And again these results are shared freely All while synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild these viruses are sold online to anyone without any or very little tracking As the tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper and easy to use and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying it s only a matter of time before a well meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomb of viruses a superbug that will cause millions of deaths And someone uses it Maybe because they have bad intentions maybe because they re irresponsible or sloppy We re creating an environment in which it s increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized virus in their backyard This is scary The world will be plunged into an unending crisis as new pandemics pop up year after year or all at once killing large parts of the world s population doing unimaginable damage to civilization as a whole and possibly undoing centuries of progress What can we do Turns out a lot It s not the first time we ve faced a challenge like this and we are not helpless Think of nuclear technology Something extremely powerful and dangerous with huge upsides and downsides Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs so its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused From the very beginning it was clear that knowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost care So a lot of effort has gone into making sure no radioactive material disappears from sight or that countries don t try to hide weapons development behind energy programs The result hasn t been perfect but considering the 411 nuclear power stations running today we ve been very successful Likewise no researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb making machines on the internet There s no reason we couldn t handle the really dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way Experts have come up with three sort of bullet points First we need to delay the next deadly pandemic by getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses Their genetic data should be treated as an info hazard information that poses a danger to society if it s shared without care In other words not just anyone should be able to order dangerous DNA online And if you do you should be tracked so it becomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff The next step is detecting the danger by becoming aware which viruses are present among us and are spreading explosively between humans This could be as easy as having labs in population centers maintain virus detectors that monitor what s going on in the micro world If we suddenly see certain microorganisms show up a lot in a short time we can react quickly and start countermeasures Which is the final step destroy We basically need to build a machine that s ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over We can do this with new tools that are being developed right now like nanofilters that pull dangers out of the air we breathe or specialized UV lamps that just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person to person And of course we need to get better at getting new vaccines faster than ever before in history If we do these three things the chances are really good that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future Biotechnology like any exciting and powerful technology is neither inherently good or bad It has the potential to be both in breathtaking ways We have the chance to have a future where we get to truly control biology Our biology The biology of the plants and animals around us and the biology of the micro world So let s use it to create a future where we triumph over pandemics and diseases for good in the most efficient way We put a link and further reading in the description and sources Aside from BioRisk there are more guides to check out too Let s tell you about one of the most embarrassing moments in Kurzgesagt history It s a pretty great story A few years ago we posted an image of a fake evolutionary tree on social media just to post something nice without thinking about it But we messed with the wrong verbs Immediately we got thousands of messages from you telling us how wrong it was unscientific bad We underestimated that you take everything that we put out into the world seriously and you set high standards for our research and fact checking process This hurt A lot We wanted to be better than that So we deleted it and contacted experts and spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration and developed a new visualization of the relationships between species that didn t exist before A map of evolution you can use to figure out how closely you re related to a flying lemur Expert approved We were extremely proud of the result and since we d spent so much time on it we turned it into a poster And from that a new vision was born We wanted to become the best infographic and science poster shop in the world Today we ve designed almost 100 posters and sold over half a million copies Every single one made with love care and lots of attention to detail All because you guys challenged us Thank you so much for that and for supporting our weird ideas and our sometimes weird merch Because of you we can continue to release our videos for free for everyone and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts to spark curiosity in people all around the world Thank you so so much for being part of our vision We literally couldn t do it without you"

        "title": "The Coronavirus Explained & What You Should Do",
        "transcript": "In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities In the following months it spread to other countries with cases doubling within days This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called COVID 19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins arguably not even a living thing It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell Corona may spread via surfaces but it s still uncertain how long it can survive on them Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough or if you touch someone who s ill and then your face say rubbing your eyes or nose The virus starts its journey here and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines the spleen or the lungs where it can have the most dramatic effect Even just a few coronaviruses can cause quite a dramatic situation The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells These are the border cells of your body lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim s membranes to inject its genetic material The cell ignorant of what s happening executes the new instructions which are pretty simple copy and reassemble It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order self destruct the cell sort of melts away releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells the number of infected cells grows exponentially after about 10 days millions of body cells are infected and billions of viruses swarm the lungs the virus has not caused much damage yet but corona is now going to release a real beast on you your own immune system The immune system while there to protect you can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus corona infects some of them and creates confusion Cells have neither ears nor eyes They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder In a sense it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should wasting its resources and causing damage Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc First neutrophiles which are great at killing stuff including ourselves As they arrive in their thousands they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T cells which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide Confused as they are they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too The more and more immune cells arrive the more damage they do and the more healthy lung tissue they kill This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage that leads to lifelong disabilities In most cases the immune system slowly regains control It kills the infected cells intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield Recovery begins The majority of people infected by corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms but many cases become severe or even critical we don t know the percentage because not all cases have been identified but it s safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu in more severe cases millions of epithelial cells have died and with them the lungs protective lining is gone That means that the alveoli tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs can be infected by bacteria that aren t usually a big problem Patients get pneumonia respiration becomes hard or even fails and patients need ventilators to survive The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply it is overwhelmed They enter the blood and overrun the body If this happens death is very likely The coronavirus is often compared to the flu but actually it s much more dangerous While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic we know for sure that it s much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu There are two futures for a pandemic like corona fast and slow Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives A slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no countermeasures in place to slow it down Why is this so bad In a fast pandemic many people get sick at the same time If the numbers get too large healthcare systems become unable to handle it There aren t enough resources like medical staff or equipment like ventilators left to help everybody People will die untreated And as more healthcare workers get sick themselves the capacity of healthcare systems falls even further If this becomes the case then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn t The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario To avoid this the world that means all of us needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses especially in the early phase so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there s no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals Since we don t have a vaccine for corona we have to socially engineer our behaviour to act like a social vaccine This simply means two things Not getting infected and not infecting others Although it sounds trivial the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands Soap is actually a powerful tool The coronavirus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat Soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you It also makes your hands slippery and with the mechanical motions of washing viruses are ripped away To do it properly wash your hands as if you ve just cut up some jalapenos and want to put in your contacts next The next thing is social distancing which is not a nice experience but a nice thing to do This means no hugging no handshakes If you can stay at home stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function From doctors to cashiers or police officers You depend on all of them They all depend on you to not get sick On a larger level there are quarantines which can mean different things from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular But they buy us and especially the researchers working on medication and vaccination crucial time So if you are put under quarantine you should understand why and respect it None of this is fun But looking at the big picture it is a really small price to pay The question of how pandemics end depends on how they start If they start fast with a steep slope they end badly If they start slow with a not so steep slope they end okayish And in this day and age it really is in all of our hands Literally and figuratively A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video Especially Our World in Data the online publication for research and data on the world s largest problems and how to make progress solving them Check out their site It also includes a constantly updated page on the corona

        "title": "Your Tattoo is INSIDE Your Immune System. Literally",
        "transcript": "Your tattoos are inside your immune system Literally With each very tasteful piece of art you kickstart a drama with millions of deaths grand sacrifices and your immune system stepping in to protect you from yourself Let s give you a tattoo and zoom in to see what happens inside your skin The conveyor belt of death Your skin has to solve a huge problem It s your largest organ and has the most direct contact with the world around you Trillions of microbes dirt insects and vermin can t be allowed to get inside you But your skin is also constantly damaged by you moving through the world Your body solved this by making your skin a conveyor belt of death All the skin you see is actually dead stuff The alive part of your skin cells begins around 1 mm deep in the skin industrial complex Stem cells constantly clone themselves producing new skin cells that begin a journey from the inside to the outside Each new generation pushes the older ones further up As your skin cells mature they interlock with each other and produce laminar bodies tiny bags that squirt out fat to create a waterproof coat that closes any gaps between them And then they dry out and kill themselves merging together into inseparable lumps This wall of dead corpuses is consistently pushed upwards Up to 50 layers of dead cells cover your whole body and are constantly replaced by new cells moving up Every hour you shed around 200 million dead skin cells and all the dirt or bacteria that are stuck to them Tattooing this part of your skin would be useless as nothing would stick around We need to go deeper When the fleshy world explodes below the conveyor belt of death lies the dermis It s full of structural tissue and cells tiny blood vessels sensory cells that report to nerve endings the roots of your hairs sweat glands regulating your temperature and of course loads of immune cells guarding your flesh right below the moving border wall This region and below is where your new tattoo will go Okay ready The world explodes Half a dozen monoliths the size of skyscrapers slam through the 50 layers of dead cells deep into the dermis ripping huge holes into the skin only to retreat and smash through the tissue again about twice a second Tens of thousands of cells are violently killed right away ripped into pieces or damaged beyond repair Luckily you did your research and chose a responsible tattoo artist who properly disinfected their tools and your skin But you only ever get 99 9 of all bacteria and some of the survivors made it into your flesh To put it mildly your immune system is not amused at all All the death and destruction wakes up hundreds of thousands of macrophages in your dermis that rush into the open wounds to defend you Immediately they start killing bacteria release chemicals that call for reinforcements and order your blood vessels to open up and make your dermis swell up with fluid But worse than the hundreds of wounds and a few invaders is the tidal wave of chemicals that floods your tissue Tattoo ink can be made from hundreds of substances Some may even be toxic or carcinogenic Most are from heavy metals like lead nickel or chromium dissolved in distilled water The battlefield is now a wild mix of dead cell parts a few panicked bacteria blood and bodily fluids platelet cells trying to close wounds more and more fresh immune cells and the flood of tattoo ink On the scale of your cells clumps of ink particles are huge If you were the size of a cell they d range from big dogs to small office buildings Your immune system has one main job Identify what is not you and smash it until it s dead The macrophages are desperately trying to do that Like tiny octopuses they extend arm like structures and begin pulling the ink particles inside Usually when a macrophage has eaten an enemy it showers it in acid to dissolve it But this doesn t work with the ink They try and try but nothing works The particles don t react in any way And this is just the particles small enough to be devoured By now the larger chunks are surrounded by thousands of your structural skin cells and macrophages that are nomming on them bathing them in acid and attack chemicals trying to destroy and kill them But they re not moving even a tiny bit Nothing works Finally your immune system has to concede It will not win this fight so it does the next best thing not lose Your cells don t know how dangerous these metals and chemicals are but they can at least not let them spread around So they just stay in place They vacuum up all the particles they can fit into their bodies and surround the larger ones trapping them in the only prison they can build themselves Bit by bit the ink inside thousands of tiny wounds moves inside millions of immune cells that freeze in place forever On the outside you don t notice any of this Your new tattoo is fresh and the colors vibrant Your skin hurts and is irritated and swollen But wounds heal tiny holes close dead cells are replaced Bit by bit the conveyor belt of death does its job shedding dead cells ripe in color replacing them with fresh and clean ones Your tattoo becomes a little less vibrant now the ink is no longer on your skin but inside it But what you re really seeing is millions of your macrophages sitting in your dermis patiently holding the ink in place protecting your body from poison Your immune system is why your tattoo is forever Actually nothing is forever Over time your macrophages get old and die and new ones come in to gobble up the ink and keep it in place But sometimes a tiny bit of ink escapes Most of it is recaptured and locked in place but not always the exact same place You notice that as your tattoo fades out a bit and turns less sharp and crisp at its edges Some of the ink escapes the tattoo entirely It rides fluids flowing from your tissue and spreads around your body another reason why tattoo ink should ideally not be poison Your immune system also kind of doesn t want you to remove tattoos To do that usually the ink is shot at with lasers which heats up the particles until they break into smaller chunks cooking your brave macrophages in the process With every round of lasering more of your tattoo is broken down and carried away by fluids But also every time new macrophages rush into the tattoo to lock the ink in place So like hmm maybe think about it carefully before you get the name of your new bae tattooed But you do you But if you got one you can directly see your immune system protecting you This is how much your body loves you which is kind of sweet And while tattoos are probably not that big of a deal for your body if applied correctly you now know about the struggle going on inside your skin and the sacrifice of your macrophage buddies only for you to have that art forever To appreciate your amazing immune system you have to know about it first and the same goes for anything going on

        "title": "The Reason Why Cancer is so Hard to Beat",
        "transcript": "An undead city under siege Soldiers and police ruthlessly shooting down waves of zombies that flood from infected streets trying to escape and infect code it can t kill itself anymore and it s beginning to multiply rapidly At this point things are not great not terrible This cell is not yet dangerous but if nothing happens it soon will be Over a few weeks the corrupted cell keeps making copies of itself One cell turns into dozens hundreds thousands Because the original was broken its copies are breaking and mutating even more They turn into different genetic lineages clans that are working together and competing Some mutate in a way that makes them weaker others mutations don t change anything while a few become fitter and better at survival Together they now form a tiny tiny tumor Not cancer yet but getting there The growing tumor needs a lot of resources If the cells don t get food and oxygen they ll die and the problem just solves itself Unfortunately a few corrupted cells unlock a new mutation that saves them The ability to order the growth of new blood vessels And so your body provides the supply they need to survive But as the tumor continues to grow it starts causing damage Neighboring healthy cells begin to starve and die which attracts attention In a sense this tiny tumor is like a rogue town Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decide that they re no longer part of New York and start a new settlement called Tumatown which happens to occupy the same space The new city wants to grow so it orders tons of steel beams cement and drywall New buildings follow no logic are badly planned ugly and dangerously crooked They re built right in the middle of streets on top of playgrounds and on existing infrastructure The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff Many of the former residents are trapped in the middle of it and begin to starve This goes on for a while until the smell of death finally attracts attention Building inspectors and police show up In your body attracted by the stench of dead cells your immune system is activated First responder immune cells invade the tumor Macrophages and natural killer cells police forces that go right to work killing and eating tumor cells They release chemical signals that let the whole immune system know that there is cancer to be eradicated Dendritic cells the intelligence officers of your immune system collect samples of dead tumor cells and begin activating your heavy weapons helper and killer T cells We explained these specialized superweapons in another video but all you really need to know is that they have a library listing every bad thing that could come into your body While each cancer is unique there are genetic corruptions that they can t hide And your T cells know what to look for They are the deadliest cancer killers you have By the time they arrive the tumor has grown to hundreds of thousands of cells But this is about to change T cells block the growth of new blood vessels which starves thousands of tumor cells and puts an end to their growth Imagine the building inspectors switching off electricity and water and putting up roadblocks to cancer town so no more food or materials can be delivered With no way to hide from the carnage unfolding the tumor collapses as hundreds of thousands of tumor cells are massacred Their carcasses are cleaned up and consumed by macrophages that then order healthy tissue to regenerate Your body has crushed the illegal tumour town without mercy You ll never know about this fight or how many times this has happened inside your body Except in this case something didn t go as planned 2 The equilibrium phase Unfortunately natural selection spores your victory By doing its best to destroy the tumor your immune system accidentally selects the fittest tumor cells Remember the tumor consists of different lineages that keep growing and keep mutating Most of these are eradicated but just a few are more resilient One cell survives it comes from the fittest tumor lineage and was just a bit better at surviving the massacre than anyone else It decides to do it all over again But better this time This tumor cell is much stronger than any of the thousands that were killed Maybe it s better at hiding or fighting back Maybe it grows faster or is better at stealing resources Maybe it can survive with much less oxygen And so it all begins again It s like the surviving rebels that started Tumor Town have learned their lessons Now they know the law better and how to break it what permits help them and how to avoid the police And so the surviving tumor cell makes thousands of copies that mutate and form new lineages until once again a tumor has grown made up of more resilient cells The immune system doesn t care though and this time it even has experience Instead of starting with police SWAT teams go right in to tear Tumor Town down killing its inhabitants without mercy But once again they don t get everyone One of them survives a fitter tumor cell from an already fitter lineage This time it gets a cheap suit and studies the building code pretending to be a lawyer to start Tumor Town all over again This struggle now repeats a few times Each time the rebels learn a bit more about how to avoid the law If at any point the immune system gets all of the tumor cells the story ends But in this case it doesn t Finally a tumor cell changes in a way that makes it properly dangerous cancer The type that kills people How Immune cells have an off switch that deactivates them before they can attack which in principle is a good idea The immune system is extremely dangerous and in many cases it needs to be shut down like around your central nervous system But this off switch can be exploited The mutated tumor cell finds a way to switch the immune system off by targeting inhibitor receptors on anti cancer cells Inhibitor receptors stop immune cells from well killing This cell is now the powerful founder of a new lineage of cancer cells and mass produces thousands of new copies that once again change and mutate further building yet another Tumor Town 3 The escape phase The new cancer cells have become to the immune system and everything is different this time Tuba Town has been rebuilt even uglier and stranger than before but now the Cancer City Council has forged all sorts of permits As building inspectors come to shut down construction they get confused Stunned they wander off unable to order the destruction of the sprawling buildings Police try to enter the illegal city to arrest the builders and execute inhabitants But this time Tumatown has erected its own roadblocks that keep the law from entering Confused officers stand around helplessly As Tumatown slowly envelops the former Brooklyn and more and more civilians die T cell SWAT teams arrive to end this travesty But things get worse New lineages of Tumor Town officials have started to forge court documents that order police to shoot at the SWAT teams What the cancer cells are doing at this point is actively shutting down immune defenses by sending corrupt signals The now malignant tumor is no longer a pushover and has begun creating the cancer microenvironment a sort of borderland that s hard to cross All avenues of attack have been shut down and uncontrollable growth is the consequence This is a dangerous tumor Cells that are strong and able to fight push your immune system back and expand further If more mutations happen then some of the cancer cells will begin to explore the world and expand into other tissues to build new towns And this is exactly what makes cancer so harmful It s taking up space and stealing so many nutrients that your true self has no room to function anymore If this goes on for too long organs will shut down But this tactic is a dead end The more successful cancer gets the more damage it does to its world When the body dies the cancer dies too It truly is a game without winners Except humanity is planning to win this game At this very moment hundreds of thousands of scientists are working on new and better ways of killing cancer to destroy and burn down tumour towns for good In recent years immunotherapy has made enormous progress It s a relatively new therapy in which your own immune cells are modified to kill cancer better than any medicine can do It s like giving your building inspectors machine guns and flamethrowers But this is a story for another time For now cancer is a battleground But if human ingenuity is to be trusted then one day maybe in the not too distant future we will eradicate it once and for all This video was made possible in part by direct viewer

        "title": "Why Blue Whales Don't Get Cancer - Peto's Paradox",
        "transcript": "Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing In the process of trying to understand it to get better at killing it we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day Large animals seem to be immune to cancer which doesn t make any sense The bigger a being the more cancer it should have To understand why we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself Our cells are protein robots made out of hundreds of millions of parts Guided only by chemical reactions they create and dismantle structures sustain a metabolism to gain energy or make almost perfect copies of themselves We call these complex chemical reactions pathways They are biochemical networks upon networks intertwined and stacked on top of each other Most of them can barely be comprehended by a single human mind and yet they function perfectly Until they don t With billions of trillions of reactions happening in thousands of networks over many years the question is not if something will go wrong but when Tiny mistakes add up until the grandiose machinery gets corrupted To prevent this from getting out of hand our cells have kill switches that make them commit suicide But these kill switches are not infallible If they fail a cell can turn into a cancer cell Most of them are slain by the immune system very quickly But this is a numbers game Given enough time a cell will accrue enough mistakes slip by unnoticed and begin making more of itself All animals have to deal with this problem In general the cells of different animals are the same size The cells of a mouse aren t smaller than yours It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance of things going wrong or cells mutating Or at least it should mean that Humans live about 50 times longer and have 1 000 times more cells than mice Yet the rate of cancer is basically the same in humans and in mice Even weirder blue whales with about 3 000 times more cells than humans don t seem to get cancer at all really This is Pitot s paradox the baffling realization that large animals have much much less cancer than they should Scientists think there are two main ways of explaining the which added more and more cells and hence more and more chances that cells could be corrupted So the collective had to invest in better and better cancer defenses The ones that did not died out But cancer doesn t just happen it s a process that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several specific genes within the same cell These genes are called proto oncogenes and when they mutate it s bad news For example with the right mutation a cell will lose its ability to kill itself Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide Another and it will send out calls for resources Another one and it will multiply quickly These oncogenes have an antagonist though Tumor suppressor genes They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself if they decide it s beyond repair It turns out that large animals have an increased number of them Because of this elephant cells require more mutations than mice cells to develop a tumor They are not immune but more resilient This adaption probably comes with a cost in some form but researchers still aren t sure what it is Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly injuries heal We don t know yet But the solution to the paradox may actually be something different Hyper tumors Solution 2 Hyper tumors Yes really Hyper tumors are named after hyper parasites the parasites of parasites Hyper tumors are the tumors of tumors Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation Normally cells work together to form structures like organs tissue or elements of the immune system But cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short term benefit If they re successful they form tumors huge cancer collectives that can be very hard to kill Making a tumor is hard work though Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly which requires a lot of resources and energy The amount of nutrients they can steal from the body becomes the limiting factor for growth So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor to feed the thing killing it And here the nature of cancer cells may become their own undoing Cancer cells are inherently unstable and so they can continue to mutate some of them faster than their buddies If they do this for a while at some point one of the copies of the copies of the original cancer cell might suddenly think of itself as an individual again and stop cooperating Which means just like the body the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy fighting for the same scarce nutrients and resources So the newly mutated cells can create a hyper tumor Instead of helping they cut off the blood supply to their former buddies which will starve and kill the original cancer cells Cancer is killing cancer This process can repeat over and over And this may prevent cancer from becoming a problem for a large organism It is possible that large animals have more of these hyper tumors than we realize They might just not become big enough to notice Which makes sense A 2 gram tumor is 10 of a mouse s body weight while it s less than 0 002 of a human and 0 00002 of a blue whale All three tumors require the same number of cell divisions and have the same number of cells So an old blue whale might be filled with tiny cancers and just not care There are other proposed solutions to Pitot s paradox such as different metabolic rates or different cellular architecture But right now we just don t know Scientists are working on the problem Figuring out how large animals are so resilient to one of the most deadly diseases we know could open the path to new therapies and treatments Cancer has always been a challenge Today we are finally beginning to understand it and by doing so one day we might finally overcome it"

        "transcript": "What makes Ebola so dangerous How can a virus overwhelm the very complex defense system of the body so quickly and so effectively Let s take a look at what Ebola does Ebola is a virus A virus is a very small thing A bit of RNA or DNA and a few proteins in a hull It has no ability to do anything by itself whatsoever and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells To avoid this we have the immune system The immune system is super complex so we developed a visual system that makes it easy to understand So it looks like this Let s concentrate on the part that s critical to understanding Ebola and ignore the rest So usually dendritic cells would activate an army of antivirus cells support cells and antibody factories that would together with the guard cells wipe out the infection in a matter of days But when Ebola strikes it directly attacks the immune system Some of the first cells it takes over are the dendritic cells the brains of the immune system The Ebola virus enters a dendritic cell by binding onto receptors for cell transport Once it s inside it dissolves its outer hull and releases its genetic material nuclear proteins and enzymes In a nutshell it takes over the cell disables the cell s protective mechanisms and reprograms it The cell now becomes a virus production machine and uses its resources to build Ebola viruses Once the cell is saturated it dissolves the cell membrane and millions of viruses are released into the tissue The virus not only prevents the dendritic cell from activating the specialized antivirus forces it manipulates it into sending signal proteins that trick the specialized cells into ending their own lives prematurely So the immune system is seriously disrupted and unable to react while the virus rapidly multiplies We re talking billions There are cells that should deal with infected cells the natural killer cells But they also get infected and just die before they can prevent the disease from spreading At the same time Ebola infects the guard cells of the body macrophages and monocytes Not only managing to circumvent their defenses it also manipulates them to signal to the cells that make up the blood vessels telling them to release fluids into the body Usually this makes sense but in this case it just causes mayhem All over the body neutrophils are activated awoken by the virus and the macrophages signals They re not very effective against viruses and should not be involved in this fight and begin to do lots of stuff they shouldn t do The neutrophils signal the blood vessels to release more fluid causing internal bleeding Another area of the body Ebola attacks is the liver The virus finds it very easy to enter the liver and it quickly starts killing loads of liver cells and causing organ failure and more internal bleeding And all of those things are going on at the same time As the virus spreads it s like nukes exploding everywhere One incident of this in one region would be problem enough but now it s starting to happen everywhere at once All the mechanisms the immune system has evolved to handle infections work against you and the virus continues to spread and spread and finally begins to infect more and more body cells while the body desperately struggles to stay alive In a desperate last effort to turn the tide the immune system launches a cytokine storm A cytokine storm is an SOS signal that causes the immune system to launch all of its weapons all at once in a desperate kamikaze attack This hurts the virus but leaves behind tons of collateral damage especially in the blood vessels Paradoxically the healthier the immune system the more damage it can do to itself More and more fluid leaves the bloodstream Blood pours out of every opening of the body You become seriously dehydrated There s just not enough blood left to supply the organs with oxygen and cells begin to die If you reach this point the chance of you dying is very high Currently 6 out of 10 infected die from Ebola Wow Okay Ebola is nasty So it s time to panic right No not even close The severity of Ebola gets papers sold and YouTube videos shared so everybody is talking about Ebola But currently the only way to get infected by Ebola is to come into contact with the bodily fluids of a person who shows symptoms or from an infected bat So just don t do that Ebola has killed 5 000 people since June 2014 The common flu kills up to 500 000 people each year Malaria kills up to 1 million each year 3 000 people every single day 10 children since this video started So even if Ebola is terrible and scary don t let yourself be scared The most infectious thing about Ebola is the media hype around it You could learn a bit more about the immune system though you"
